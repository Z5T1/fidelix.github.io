<h1>2020-05-31: nginx has Landed in Master; i686 Port is Underway</h1>

<p>
I am please to announce that <a href=http://nginx.org/>nginx</a> 1.18.0 is now available in the master branch under daemon/nginx. This marks another daemon down. As an added bonus, tab complete and line editing history work on the sftp client now. In the near future, we are currently planning to add Exim, OpenNTPD, a DNS server (which one is TBD), and MariaDB.
</p>

<p>
A port of Fidelix to the i686 architecture is under way.
<p>

<p>
We are looking for people who would be interested in helping to port a few daemons to the base system. If you are interested in helping, please send an email to <a href=mailto:z5t1@z5t1.com>z5t1@z5t1.com</a>.
