The <b>getrlimit</b>() and <b>setrlimit</b>() system calls get and set resource
  limits. Each resource has an associated soft and hard limit, as defined by the
  <i>rlimit</i> structure:
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
struct rlimit {
    rlim_t rlim_cur;  /* Soft limit */
    rlim_t rlim_max;  /* Hard limit (ceiling for rlim_cur) */
};

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">The soft limit is the value that the kernel enforces for the
    corresponding resource. The hard limit acts as a ceiling for the soft limit:
    an unprivileged process may set only its soft limit to a value in the range
    from 0 up to the hard limit, and (irreversibly) lower its hard limit. A
    privileged process (under Linux: one with the <b>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE</b>
    capability in the initial user namespace) may make arbitrary changes to
    either limit value.</p>
<p class="Pp">The value <b>RLIM_INFINITY</b> denotes no limit on a resource
    (both in the structure returned by <b>getrlimit</b>() and in the structure
    passed to <b>setrlimit</b>()).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>resource</i> argument must be one of:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>RLIMIT_AS</b></dt>
  <dd>This is the maximum size of the process's virtual memory (address space).
      The limit is specified in bytes, and is rounded down to the system page
      size. This limit affects calls to <b>brk</b>(2), <b>mmap</b>(2), and
      <b>mremap</b>(2), which fail with the error <b>ENOMEM</b> upon exceeding
      this limit. In addition, automatic stack expansion fails (and generates a
      <b>SIGSEGV</b> that kills the process if no alternate stack has been made
      available via <b>sigaltstack</b>(2)). Since the value is a <i>long</i>, on
      machines with a 32-bit <i>long</i> either this limit is at most
      2&#x00A0;GiB, or this resource is unlimited.</dd>
  <dt><b>RLIMIT_CORE</b></dt>
  <dd>This is the maximum size of a <i>core</i> file (see <b>core</b>(5)) in
      bytes that the process may dump. When 0 no core dump files are created.
      When nonzero, larger dumps are truncated to this size.</dd>
  <dt><b>RLIMIT_CPU</b></dt>
  <dd>This is a limit, in seconds, on the amount of CPU time that the process
      can consume. When the process reaches the soft limit, it is sent a
      <b>SIGXCPU</b> signal. The default action for this signal is to terminate
      the process. However, the signal can be caught, and the handler can return
      control to the main program. If the process continues to consume CPU time,
      it will be sent <b>SIGXCPU</b> once per second until the hard limit is
      reached, at which time it is sent <b>SIGKILL</b>. (This latter point
      describes Linux behavior. Implementations vary in how they treat processes
      which continue to consume CPU time after reaching the soft limit. Portable
      applications that need to catch this signal should perform an orderly
      termination upon first receipt of <b>SIGXCPU</b>.)</dd>
  <dt><b>RLIMIT_DATA</b></dt>
  <dd>This is the maximum size of the process's data segment (initialized data,
      uninitialized data, and heap). The limit is specified in bytes, and is
      rounded down to the system page size. This limit affects calls to
      <b>brk</b>(2), <b>sbrk</b>(2), and (since Linux 4.7) <b>mmap</b>(2), which
      fail with the error <b>ENOMEM</b> upon encountering the soft limit of this
      resource.</dd>
  <dt><b>RLIMIT_FSIZE</b></dt>
  <dd>This is the maximum size in bytes of files that the process may create.
      Attempts to extend a file beyond this limit result in delivery of a
      <b>SIGXFSZ</b> signal. By default, this signal terminates a process, but a
      process can catch this signal instead, in which case the relevant system
      call (e.g., <b>write</b>(2), <b>truncate</b>(2)) fails with the error
      <b>EFBIG</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>RLIMIT_LOCKS</b> (early Linux 2.4 only)</dt>
  <dd>This is a limit on the combined number of <b>flock</b>(2) locks and
      <b>fcntl</b>(2) leases that this process may establish.</dd>
  <dt><b>RLIMIT_MEMLOCK</b></dt>
  <dd>This is the maximum number of bytes of memory that may be locked into RAM.
      This limit is in effect rounded down to the nearest multiple of the system
      page size. This limit affects <b>mlock</b>(2), <b>mlockall</b>(2), and the
      <b>mmap</b>(2) <b>MAP_LOCKED</b> operation. Since Linux 2.6.9, it also
      affects the <b>shmctl</b>(2) <b>SHM_LOCK</b> operation, where it sets a
      maximum on the total bytes in shared memory segments (see
      <b>shmget</b>(2)) that may be locked by the real user ID of the calling
      process. The <b>shmctl</b>(2) <b>SHM_LOCK</b> locks are accounted for
      separately from the per-process memory locks established by
      <b>mlock</b>(2), <b>mlockall</b>(2), and <b>mmap</b>(2) <b>MAP_LOCKED</b>;
      a process can lock bytes up to this limit in each of these two
    categories.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>In Linux kernels before 2.6.9, this limit controlled the amount of memory
      that could be locked by a privileged process. Since Linux 2.6.9, no limits
      are placed on the amount of memory that a privileged process may lock, and
      this limit instead governs the amount of memory that an unprivileged
      process may lock.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>RLIMIT_MSGQUEUE</b> (since Linux 2.6.8)</dt>
  <dd>This is a limit on the number of bytes that can be allocated for POSIX
      message queues for the real user ID of the calling process. This limit is
      enforced for <b>mq_open</b>(3). Each message queue that the user creates
      counts (until it is removed) against this limit according to the

  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The &quot;overhead&quot; addend in the formula accounts for overhead bytes

      range for this limit is thus from 1 (corresponding to a nice value of 19)
      to 40 (corresponding to a nice value of -20). This unusual choice of range
      was necessary because negative numbers cannot be specified as resource
      limit values, since they typically have special meanings. For example,

  both set and get the resource limits of an arbitrary process.
<p class="Pp">The <i>resource</i> argument has the same meaning as for
    <b>setrlimit</b>() and <b>getrlimit</b>().</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <i>new_limit</i> argument is a not NULL, then the
    <i>rlimit</i> structure to which it points is used to set new values for the
    soft and hard limits for <i>resource</i>. If the <i>old_limit</i> argument

In older Linux kernels, the <b>SIGXCPU</b> and <b>SIGKILL</b> signals delivered
  when a process encountered the soft and hard <b>RLIMIT_CPU</b> limits were
  delivered one (CPU) second later than they should have been. This was fixed in
  kernel 2.6.8.
<p class="Pp">In 2.6.x kernels before 2.6.17, a <b>RLIMIT_CPU</b> limit of 0 is
    wrongly treated as &quot;no limit&quot; (like <b>RLIM_INFINITY</b>). Since
    Linux 2.6.17, setting a limit of 0 does have an effect, but is actually
    treated as a limit of 1 second.</p>
<p class="Pp">A kernel bug means that <b>RLIMIT_RTPRIO</b> does not work in
    kernel 2.6.12; the problem is fixed in kernel 2.6.13.</p>
<p class="Pp">In kernel 2.6.12, there was an off-by-one mismatch between the
    priority ranges returned by <b>getpriority</b>(2) and <b>RLIMIT_NICE</b>.
    This had the effect that the actual ceiling for the nice value was
    calculated as <i>19&#x00A0;-&#x00A0;rlim_cur</i>. This was fixed in kernel
    2.6.13.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 2.6.12, if a process reaches its soft
    <b>RLIMIT_CPU</b> limit and has a handler installed for <b>SIGXCPU</b>,
    then, in addition to invoking the signal handler, the kernel increases the
    soft limit by one second. This behavior repeats if the process continues to
    consume CPU time, until the hard limit is reached, at which point the
    process is killed. Other implementations do not change the <b>RLIMIT_CPU</b>
    soft limit in this manner, and the Linux behavior is probably not standards
    conformant; portable applications should avoid relying on this
    Linux-specific behavior. The Linux-specific <b>RLIMIT_RTTIME</b> limit
    exhibits the same behavior when the soft limit is encountered.</p>
<p class="Pp">Kernels before 2.4.22 did not diagnose the error <b>EINVAL</b> for

  system calls is a (32-bit) <i>unsigned long</i>. Furthermore, in Linux, the
  kernel represents resource limits on 32-bit platforms as <i>unsigned long</i>.
  However, a 32-bit data type is not wide enough. The most pertinent limit here
  is <b>RLIMIT_FSIZE</b>, which specifies the maximum size to which a file can
  grow: to be useful, this limit must be represented using a type that is as
  wide as the type used to represent file offsets&#x2014;that is, as wide as a
  64-bit <b>off_t</b> (assuming a program compiled with
  <i>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64</i>).
<p class="Pp">To work around this kernel limitation, if a program tried to set a
    resource limit to a value larger than can be represented in a 32-bit
    <i>unsigned long</i>, then the glibc <b>setrlimit</b>() wrapper function
    silently converted the limit value to <b>RLIM_INFINITY</b>. In other words,
    the requested resource limit setting was silently ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since version 2.13, glibc works around the limitations of the
    <b>getrlimit</b>() and <b>setrlimit</b>() system calls by implementing
    <b>setrlimit</b>() and <b>getrlimit</b>() as wrapper functions that call
    <b>prlimit</b>().</p>
