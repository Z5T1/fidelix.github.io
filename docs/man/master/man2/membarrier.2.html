The <b>membarrier</b>() system call helps reducing the overhead of the memory
  barrier instructions required to order memory accesses on multi-core systems.
  However, this system call is heavier than a memory barrier, so using it
  effectively is <i>not</i> as simple as replacing memory barriers with this
  system call, but requires understanding of the details below.
<p class="Pp">Use of memory barriers needs to be done taking into account that a
    memory barrier always needs to be either matched with its memory barrier
    counterparts, or that the architecture's memory model doesn't require the
    matching barriers.</p>
<p class="Pp">There are cases where one side of the matching barriers (which we
    will refer to as &quot;fast side&quot;) is executed much more often than the
    other (which we will refer to as &quot;slow side&quot;). This is a prime
    target for the use of <b>membarrier</b>(). The key idea is to replace, for
    these matching barriers, the fast-side memory barriers by simple compiler
    barriers, for example:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
asm volatile (&quot;&quot; : : : &quot;memory&quot;)

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">and replace the slow-side memory barriers by calls to
    <b>membarrier</b>().</p>
<p class="Pp">This will add overhead to the slow side, and remove overhead from
    the fast side, thus resulting in an overall performance increase as long as
    the slow side is infrequent enough that the overhead of the
    <b>membarrier</b>() calls does not outweigh the performance gain on the fast
    side.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>cmd</i> argument is one of the following:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_QUERY</b> (since Linux 4.3)</dt>
  <dd>Query the set of supported commands. The return value of the call is a bit
      mask of supported commands. <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_QUERY</b>, which has the
      value 0, is not itself included in this bit mask. This command is always
      supported (on kernels where <b>membarrier</b>() is provided).</dd>
  <dt><b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_GLOBAL</b> (since Linux 4.16)</dt>
  <dd>Ensure that all threads from all processes on the system pass through a
      state where all memory accesses to user-space addresses match program
      order between entry to and return from the <b>membarrier</b>() system
      call. All threads on the system are targeted by this command.</dd>
  <dt><b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_GLOBAL_EXPEDITED</b> (since Linux 4.16)</dt>
  <dd>Execute a memory barrier on all running threads of all processes that

    table for each pairing of <i>barrier()</i>, <b>membarrier</b>() and

On success, the <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_QUERY</b> operation returns a bit mask of
  supported commands, and the <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_GLOBAL</b>,

  <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_REGISTER_GLOBAL_EXPEDITED</b>,

  <b>MEMBARRIER_CMD_REGISTER_PRIVATE_EXPEDITED_SYNC_CORE</b> operations return
  zero. On error, -1 is returned, and <i>errno</i> is set appropriately.
<p class="Pp">For a given command, with <i>flags</i> set to 0, this system call
    is guaranteed to always return the same value until reboot. Further calls
    with the same arguments will lead to the same result. Therefore, with
    <i>flags</i> set to 0, error handling is required only for the first call to

A memory barrier instruction is part of the instruction set of architectures
  with weakly-ordered memory models. It orders memory accesses prior to the
  barrier and after the barrier with respect to matching barriers on other
  cores. For instance, a load fence can order loads prior to and following that
  fence with respect to stores ordered by store fences.
<p class="Pp">Program order is the order in which instructions are ordered in
    the program assembly code.</p>
<p class="Pp">Examples where <b>membarrier</b>() can be useful include
    implementations of Read-Copy-Update libraries and garbage collectors.</p>

static void
slow_path(int *read_a)
{
    b = 1;
    asm volatile (&quot;mfence&quot; : : : &quot;memory&quot;);
