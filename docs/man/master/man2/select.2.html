<b>select</b>() and <b>pselect</b>() allow a program to monitor multiple file
  descriptors, waiting until one or more of the file descriptors become
  &quot;ready&quot; for some class of I/O operation (e.g., input possible). A
  file descriptor is considered ready if it is possible to perform a
  corresponding I/O operation (e.g., <b>read</b>(2), or a sufficiently small
  <b>write</b>(2)) without blocking.
<p class="Pp"><b>select</b>() can monitor only file descriptors numbers that are
    less than <b>FD_SETSIZE</b>; <b>poll</b>(2) does not have this limitation.
    See BUGS.</p>
<p class="Pp">The operation of <b>select</b>() and <b>pselect</b>() is
    identical, other than these three differences:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>(i)</dt>
  <dd><b>select</b>() uses a timeout that is a <i>struct timeval</i> (with
      seconds and microseconds), while <b>pselect</b>() uses a <i>struct
      timespec</i> (with seconds and nanoseconds).</dd>
  <dt>(ii)</dt>
  <dd><b>select</b>() may update the <i>timeout</i> argument to indicate how
      much time was left. <b>pselect</b>() does not change this argument.</dd>
  <dt>(iii)</dt>
  <dd><b>select</b>() has no <i>sigmask</i> argument, and behaves as
      <b>pselect</b>() called with NULL <i>sigmask</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Three independent sets of file descriptors are watched. The file
    descriptors listed in <i>readfds</i> will be watched to see if characters
    become available for reading (more precisely, to see if a read will not
    block; in particular, a file descriptor is also ready on end-of-file). The
    file descriptors in <i>writefds</i> will be watched to see if space is
    available for write (though a large write may still block). The file
    descriptors in <i>exceptfds</i> will be watched for exceptional conditions.
    (For examples of some exceptional conditions, see the discussion of
    <b>POLLPRI</b> in <b>poll</b>(2).)</p>
<p class="Pp">On exit, each of the file descriptor sets is modified in place to
    indicate which file descriptors actually changed status. (Thus, if using
    <b>select</b>() within a loop, the sets must be reinitialized before each
    call.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Each of the three file descriptor sets may be specified as NULL if
    no file descriptors are to be watched for the corresponding class of
  events.</p>
<p class="Pp">Four macros are provided to manipulate the sets. <b>FD_ZERO</b>()
    clears a set. <b>FD_SET</b>() and <b>FD_CLR</b>() add and remove a given
    file descriptor from a set. <b>FD_ISSET</b>() tests to see if a file
    descriptor is part of the set; this is useful after <b>select</b>()
  returns.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>nfds</i> should be set to the highest-numbered file descriptor
    in any of the three sets, plus 1. The indicated file descriptors in each set
    are checked, up to this limit (but see BUGS).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>timeout</i> argument specifies the interval that
    <b>select</b>() should block waiting for a file descriptor to become ready.
    The call will block until either:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>a file descriptor becomes ready;</li>
  <li>the call is interrupted by a signal handler; or</li>
  <li>the timeout expires.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Note that the <i>timeout</i> interval will be rounded up to the
    system clock granularity, and kernel scheduling delays mean that the
    blocking interval may overrun by a small amount. If both fields of the
    <i>timeval</i> structure are zero, then <b>select</b>() returns immediately.
    (This is useful for polling.) If <i>timeout</i> is NULL (no timeout),
    <b>select</b>() can block indefinitely.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>sigmask</i> is a pointer to a signal mask (see
    <b>sigprocmask</b>(2)); if it is not NULL, then <b>pselect</b>() first
    replaces the current signal mask by the one pointed to by <i>sigmask</i>,
    then does the &quot;select&quot; function, and then restores the original
    signal mask.</p>
<p class="Pp">Other than the difference in the precision of the <i>timeout</i>
    argument, the following <b>pselect</b>() call:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
ready = pselect(nfds, &amp;readfds, &amp;writefds, &amp;exceptfds,
                timeout, &amp;sigmask);

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">is equivalent to <i>atomically</i> executing the following
  calls:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
sigset_t origmask;
pthread_sigmask(SIG_SETMASK, &amp;sigmask, &amp;origmask);
ready = select(nfds, &amp;readfds, &amp;writefds, &amp;exceptfds, timeout);
pthread_sigmask(SIG_SETMASK, &amp;origmask, NULL);

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">The reason that <b>pselect</b>() is needed is that if one wants to
    wait for either a signal or for a file descriptor to become ready, then an
    atomic test is needed to prevent race conditions. (Suppose the signal
    handler sets a global flag and returns. Then a test of this global flag
    followed by a call of <b>select</b>() could hang indefinitely if the signal
    arrived just after the test but just before the call. By contrast,
    <b>pselect</b>() allows one to first block signals, handle the signals that
    have come in, then call <b>pselect</b>() with the desired <i>sigmask</i>,
    avoiding the race.)</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="The_timeout"><a class="permalink" href="#The_timeout">The

The time structures involved are defined in <i>&lt;sys/time.h&gt;</i> and look
  like
<p class="Pp">

};

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">(However, see below on the POSIX.1 versions.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Some code calls <b>select</b>() with all three sets empty,
    <i>nfds</i> zero, and a non-NULL <i>timeout</i> as a fairly portable way to
    sleep with subsecond precision.</p>
<p class="Pp">On Linux, <b>select</b>() modifies <i>timeout</i> to reflect the
    amount of time not slept; most other implementations do not do this.
    (POSIX.1 permits either behavior.) This causes problems both when Linux code
    which reads <i>timeout</i> is ported to other operating systems, and when
    code is ported to Linux that reuses a <i>struct timeval</i> for multiple
    <b>select</b>()s in a loop without reinitializing it. Consider
    <i>timeout</i> to be undefined after <b>select</b>() returns.</p>

<b>select</b>() conforms to POSIX.1-2001, POSIX.1-2008, and 4.4BSD
  (<b>select</b>() first appeared in 4.2BSD). Generally portable to/from non-BSD
  systems supporting clones of the BSD socket layer (including System&#x00A0;V
  variants). However, note that the System&#x00A0;V variant typically sets the
  timeout variable before exit, but the BSD variant does not.

An <i>fd_set</i> is a fixed size buffer. Executing <b>FD_CLR</b>() or
  <b>FD_SET</b>() with a value of <i>fd</i> that is negative or is equal to or
  larger than <b>FD_SETSIZE</b> will result in undefined behavior. Moreover,
  POSIX requires <i>fd</i> to be a valid file descriptor.
<p class="Pp">The operation of <b>select</b>() and <b>pselect</b>() is not
    affected by the <b>O_NONBLOCK</b> flag.</p>
<p class="Pp">On some other UNIX systems, <b>select</b>() can fail with the
    error <b>EAGAIN</b> if the system fails to allocate kernel-internal
    resources, rather than <b>ENOMEM</b> as Linux does. POSIX specifies this
    error for <b>poll</b>(2), but not for <b>select</b>(). Portable programs may
    wish to check for <b>EAGAIN</b> and loop, just as with <b>EINTR</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">On systems that lack <b>pselect</b>(), reliable (and more
    portable) signal trapping can be achieved using the self-pipe trick. In this
    technique, a signal handler writes a byte to a pipe whose other end is
    monitored by <b>select</b>() in the main program. (To avoid possibly
    blocking when writing to a pipe that may be full or reading from a pipe that
    may be empty, nonblocking I/O is used when reading from and writing to the
    pipe.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Concerning the types involved, the classical situation is that the
    two fields of a <i>timeval</i> structure are typed as <i>long</i> (as shown
    above), and the structure is defined in <i>&lt;sys/time.h&gt;</i>. The
    POSIX.1 situation is</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
struct timeval {
    time_t         tv_sec;     /* seconds */
    suseconds_t    tv_usec;    /* microseconds */
};

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">where the structure is defined in <i>&lt;sys/select.h&gt;</i> and
    the data types <i>time_t</i> and <i>suseconds_t</i> are defined in
    <i>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Concerning prototypes, the classical situation is that one should
    include <i>&lt;time.h&gt;</i> for <b>select</b>(). The POSIX.1 situation is
    that one should include <i>&lt;sys/select.h&gt;</i> for <b>select</b>() and
    <b>pselect</b>().</p>
<p class="Pp">Under glibc 2.0, <i>&lt;sys/select.h&gt;</i> gives the wrong
    prototype for <b>pselect</b>(). Under glibc 2.1 to 2.2.1, it gives
    <b>pselect</b>() when <b>_GNU_SOURCE</b> is defined. Since glibc 2.2.2, the
    requirements are as shown in the SYNOPSIS.</p>

If a file descriptor being monitored by <b>select</b>() is closed in another
  thread, the result is unspecified. On some UNIX systems, <b>select</b>()
  unblocks and returns, with an indication that the file descriptor is ready (a
  subsequent I/O operation will likely fail with an error, unless another
  process reopens file descriptor between the time <b>select</b>() returned and
  the I/O operation is performed). On Linux (and some other systems), closing
  the file descriptor in another thread has no effect on <b>select</b>(). In
  summary, any application that relies on a particular behavior in this scenario
  must be considered buggy.

<h2 class="Ss" id="C_library/kernel_differences"><a class="permalink" href="#C_library/kernel_differences">C
  library/kernel differences</a></h2>
The Linux kernel allows file descriptor sets of arbitrary size, determining the
  length of the sets to be checked from the value of <i>nfds</i>. However, in
  the glibc implementation, the <i>fd_set</i> type is fixed in size. See also
  BUGS.
<p class="Pp">The <b>pselect</b>() interface described in this page is
    implemented by glibc. The underlying Linux system call is named
    <b>pselect6</b>(). This system call has somewhat different behavior from the
    glibc wrapper function.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Linux <b>pselect6</b>() system call modifies its
    <i>timeout</i> argument. However, the glibc wrapper function hides this
    behavior by using a local variable for the timeout argument that is passed
    to the system call. Thus, the glibc <b>pselect</b>() function does not
    modify its <i>timeout</i> argument; this is the behavior required by
    POSIX.1-2001.</p>
<p class="Pp">The final argument of the <b>pselect6</b>() system call is not a
    <i>sigset_t&#x00A0;*</i> pointer, but is instead a structure of the
  form:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
struct {
    const kernel_sigset_t *ss;   /* Pointer to signal set */
    size_t ss_len;               /* Size (in bytes) of object
                                    pointed to by 'ss' */
};

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">This allows the system call to obtain both a pointer to the signal
    set and its size, while allowing for the fact that most architectures
    support a maximum of 6 arguments to a system call. See <b>sigprocmask</b>(2)
    for a discussion of the difference between the kernel and libc notion of the
    signal set.</p>
</section>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
POSIX allows an implementation to define an upper limit, advertised via the
  constant <b>FD_SETSIZE</b>, on the range of file descriptors that can be
  specified in a file descriptor set. The Linux kernel imposes no fixed limit,
  but the glibc implementation makes <i>fd_set</i> a fixed-size type, with
  <b>FD_SETSIZE</b> defined as 1024, and the <b>FD_*</b>() macros operating
  according to that limit. To monitor file descriptors greater than 1023, use
  <b>poll</b>(2) instead.
<p class="Pp">The implementation of the <i>fd_set</i> arguments as value-result
    arguments means that they must be reinitialized on each call to
    <b>select</b>(). This design error is avoided by <b>poll</b>(2), which uses
    separate structure fields for the input and output of the call.</p>
<p class="Pp">According to POSIX, <b>select</b>() should check all specified
    file descriptors in the three file descriptor sets, up to the limit
    <i>nfds-1</i>. However, the current implementation ignores any file
    descriptor in these sets that is greater than the maximum file descriptor
    number that the process currently has open. According to POSIX, any such
    file descriptor that is specified in one of the sets should result in the
    error <b>EBADF</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Glibc 2.0 provided a version of <b>pselect</b>() that did not take
    a <i>sigmask</i> argument.</p>
<p class="Pp">Starting with version 2.1, glibc provided an emulation of
    <b>pselect</b>() that was implemented using <b>sigprocmask</b>(2) and
    <b>select</b>(). This implementation remained vulnerable to the very race
    condition that <b>pselect</b>() was designed to prevent. Modern versions of
    glibc use the (race-free) <b>pselect</b>() system call on kernels where it
    is provided.</p>
<p class="Pp">Under Linux, <b>select</b>() may report a socket file descriptor
    as &quot;ready for reading&quot;, while nevertheless a subsequent read
    blocks. This could for example happen when data has arrived but upon
    examination has wrong checksum and is discarded. There may be other
    circumstances in which a file descriptor is spuriously reported as ready.
    Thus it may be safer to use <b>O_NONBLOCK</b> on sockets that should not
    block.</p>
<p class="Pp">On Linux, <b>select</b>() also modifies <i>timeout</i> if the call
    is interrupted by a signal handler (i.e., the <b>EINTR</b> error return).
    This is not permitted by POSIX.1. The Linux <b>pselect</b>() system call has
    the same behavior, but the glibc wrapper hides this behavior by internally
    copying the <i>timeout</i> to a local variable and passing that variable to
    the system call.</p>
