A successful <b>IPC_INFO</b> or <b>SHM_INFO</b> operation returns the index of

The inclusion of <i>&lt;sys/types.h&gt;</i> and <i>&lt;sys/ipc.h&gt;</i> isn't
  required on Linux or by any version of POSIX. However, some old
  implementations required the inclusion of these header files, and the SVID
  also documented their inclusion. Applications intended to be portable to such
  old systems may need to include these header files.
<p class="Pp">The <b>IPC_INFO</b>, <b>SHM_STAT</b> and <b>SHM_INFO</b>
    operations are used by the <b>ipcs</b>(1) program to provide information on
    allocated resources. In the future, these may modified or moved to a
    <i>/proc</i> filesystem interface.</p>
<p class="Pp">Linux permits a process to attach (<b>shmat</b>(2)) a shared
    memory segment that has already been marked for deletion using
    <i>shmctl(IPC_RMID)</i>. This feature is not available on other UNIX
    implementations; portable applications should avoid relying on it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Various fields in a <i>struct shmid_ds</i> were typed as
    <i>short</i> under Linux 2.2 and have become <i>long</i> under Linux 2.4. To
    take advantage of this, a recompilation under glibc-2.1.91 or later should
    suffice. (The kernel distinguishes old and new calls by an <b>IPC_64</b>
    flag in <i>cmd</i>.)</p>
