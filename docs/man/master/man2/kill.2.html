The <b>kill</b>() system call can be used to send any signal to any process
  group or process.
<p class="Pp">If <i>pid</i> is positive, then signal <i>sig</i> is sent to the
    process with the ID specified by <i>pid</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>pid</i> equals 0, then <i>sig</i> is sent to every process
    in the process group of the calling process.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>pid</i> equals -1, then <i>sig</i> is sent to every process
    for which the calling process has permission to send signals, except for
    process 1 (<i>init</i>), but see below.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>pid</i> is less than -1, then <i>sig</i> is sent to every
    process in the process group whose ID is <i>-pid</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>sig</i> is 0, then no signal is sent, but existence and
    permission checks are still performed; this can be used to check for the
    existence of a process ID or process group ID that the caller is permitted
    to signal.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a process to have permission to send a signal, it must either
    be privileged (under Linux: have the <b>CAP_KILL</b> capability in the user
    namespace of the target process), or the real or effective user ID of the
    sending process must equal the real or saved set-user-ID of the target
    process. In the case of <b>SIGCONT</b>, it suffices when the sending and
    receiving processes belong to the same session. (Historically, the rules
    were different; see NOTES.)</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="RETURN_VALUE"><a class="permalink" href="#RETURN_VALUE">RETURN
  VALUE</a></h1>
On success (at least one signal was sent), zero is returned. On error, -1 is
  returned, and <i>errno</i> is set appropriately.

The only signals that can be sent to process ID 1, the <i>init</i> process, are
  those for which <i>init</i> has explicitly installed signal handlers. This is
  done to assure the system is not brought down accidentally.
<p class="Pp">POSIX.1 requires that <i>kill(-1,sig)</i> send <i>sig</i> to all
    processes that the calling process may send signals to, except possibly for
    some implementation-defined system processes. Linux allows a process to
    signal itself, but on Linux the call <i>kill(-1,sig)</i> does not signal the
    calling process.</p>
<p class="Pp">POSIX.1 requires that if a process sends a signal to itself, and
    the sending thread does not have the signal blocked, and no other thread has
    it unblocked or is waiting for it in <b>sigwait</b>(3), at least one
    unblocked signal must be delivered to the sending thread before the
    <b>kill</b>() returns.</p>

Across different kernel versions, Linux has enforced different rules for the
  permissions required for an unprivileged process to send a signal to another
  process. In kernels 1.0 to 1.2.2, a signal could be sent if the effective user
  ID of the sender matched effective user ID of the target, or the real user ID
  of the sender matched the real user ID of the target. From kernel 1.2.3 until
  1.3.77, a signal could be sent if the effective user ID of the sender matched
  either the real or effective user ID of the target. The current rules, which
  conform to POSIX.1, were adopted in kernel 1.3.78.

In 2.6 kernels up to and including 2.6.7, there was a bug that meant that when
  sending signals to a process group, <b>kill</b>() failed with the error
  <b>EPERM</b> if the caller did not have permission to send the signal to
  <i>any</i> (rather than <i>all</i>) of the members of the process group.
  Notwithstanding this error return, the signal was still delivered to all of
  the processes for which the caller had permission to signal.
