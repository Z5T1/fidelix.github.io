All of these system calls are used to wait for state changes in a child of the
  calling process, and obtain information about the child whose state has
  changed. A state change is considered to be: the child terminated; the child
  was stopped by a signal; or the child was resumed by a signal. In the case of
  a terminated child, performing a wait allows the system to release the
  resources associated with the child; if a wait is not performed, then the
  terminated child remains in a &quot;zombie&quot; state (see NOTES below).
<p class="Pp">If a child has already changed state, then these calls return
    immediately. Otherwise, they block until either a child changes state or a
    signal handler interrupts the call (assuming that system calls are not
    automatically restarted using the <b>SA_RESTART</b> flag of
    <b>sigaction</b>(2)). In the remainder of this page, a child whose state has
    changed and which has not yet been waited upon by one of these system calls
    is termed <i>waitable</i>.</p>

The <b>wait</b>() system call suspends execution of the calling thread until one
  of its children terminates. The call <i>wait(&amp;wstatus)</i> is equivalent
  to:
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
waitpid(-1, &amp;wstatus, 0);

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">The <b>waitpid</b>() system call suspends execution of the calling
    thread until a child specified by <i>pid</i> argument has changed state. By
    default, <b>waitpid</b>() waits only for terminated children, but this
    behavior is modifiable via the <i>options</i> argument, as described
  below.</p>
<p class="Pp">The value of <i>pid</i> can be:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&lt; -1</dt>
  <dd>meaning wait for any child process whose process group ID is equal to the
      absolute value of <i>pid</i>.</dd>
  <dt>-1</dt>
  <dd>meaning wait for any child process.</dd>
  <dt>0</dt>
  <dd>meaning wait for any child process whose process group ID is equal to that
      of the calling process at the time of the call to <b>waitpid</b>().</dd>
  <dt>&gt; 0</dt>
  <dd>meaning wait for the child whose process ID is equal to the value of
      <i>pid</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The value of <i>options</i> is an OR of zero or more of the
    following constants:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>WNOHANG</b></dt>
  <dd>return immediately if no child has exited.</dd>
  <dt><b>WUNTRACED</b></dt>
  <dd>also return if a child has stopped (but not traced via <b>ptrace</b>(2)).
      Status for <i>traced</i> children which have stopped is provided even if
      this option is not specified.</dd>
  <dt><b>WCONTINUED</b> (since Linux 2.6.10)</dt>
  <dd>also return if a stopped child has been resumed by delivery of
      <b>SIGCONT</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">(For Linux-only options, see below.)</p>
<p class="Pp">If <i>wstatus</i> is not NULL, <b>wait</b>() and <b>waitpid</b>()
    store status information in the <i>int</i> to which it points. This integer
    can be inspected with the following macros (which take the integer itself as
    an argument, not a pointer to it, as is done in <b>wait</b>() and
    <b>waitpid</b>()!):</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>WIFEXITED(</b><i>wstatus</i><b>)</b></dt>
  <dd>returns true if the child terminated normally, that is, by calling
      <b>exit</b>(3) or <b>_exit</b>(2), or by returning from main().</dd>
  <dt><b>WEXITSTATUS(</b><i>wstatus</i><b>)</b></dt>
  <dd>returns the exit status of the child. This consists of the least
      significant 8 bits of the <i>status</i> argument that the child specified
      in a call to <b>exit</b>(3) or <b>_exit</b>(2) or as the argument for a
      return statement in main(). This macro should be employed only if
      <b>WIFEXITED</b> returned true.</dd>
  <dt><b>WIFSIGNALED(</b><i>wstatus</i><b>)</b></dt>
  <dd>returns true if the child process was terminated by a signal.</dd>
  <dt><b>WTERMSIG(</b><i>wstatus</i><b>)</b></dt>
  <dd>returns the number of the signal that caused the child process to
      terminate. This macro should be employed only if <b>WIFSIGNALED</b>
      returned true.</dd>
  <dt><b>WCOREDUMP(</b><i>wstatus</i><b>)</b></dt>
  <dd>returns true if the child produced a core dump (see <b>core</b>(5)). This
      macro should be employed only if <b>WIFSIGNALED</b> returned true.</dd>

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>WIFSTOPPED(</b><i>wstatus</i><b>)</b></dt>

The <b>waitid</b>() system call (available since Linux 2.6.9) provides more
  precise control over which child state changes to wait for.
<p class="Pp">The <i>idtype</i> and <i>id</i> arguments select the child(ren) to
    wait for, as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>idtype</i> == <b>P_PID</b></dt>
  <dd>Wait for the child whose process ID matches <i>id</i>.</dd>
  <dt><i>idtype</i> == <b>P_PIDFD</b> (since Linux 5.4)</dt>
  <dd>Wait for the child referred to by the PID file descriptor specified in
      <i>id</i>. (See <b>pidfd_open</b>(2) for further information on PID file
      descriptors.)</dd>
  <dt><i>idtype</i> == <b>P_PGID</b></dt>
  <dd>Wait for any child whose process group ID matches <i>id</i>. Since Linux
      5.4, if <i>id</i> is zero, then wait for any child that is in the same
      process group as the caller's process group at the time of the call.</dd>
  <dt><i>idtype</i> == <b>P_ALL</b></dt>
  <dd>Wait for any child; <i>id</i> is ignored.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The child state changes to wait for are specified by ORing one or
    more of the following flags in <i>options</i>:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>WEXITED</b></dt>
  <dd>Wait for children that have terminated.</dd>
  <dt><b>WSTOPPED</b></dt>
  <dd>Wait for children that have been stopped by delivery of a signal.</dd>
  <dt><b>WCONTINUED</b></dt>
  <dd>Wait for (previously stopped) children that have been resumed by delivery
      of <b>SIGCONT</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The following flags may additionally be ORed in
  <i>options</i>:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>WNOHANG</b></dt>
  <dd>As for <b>waitpid</b>().</dd>
  <dt><b>WNOWAIT</b></dt>
  <dd>Leave the child in a waitable state; a later wait call can be used to
      again retrieve the child status information.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Upon successful return, <b>waitid</b>() fills in the following
    fields of the <i>siginfo_t</i> structure pointed to by <i>infop</i>:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>si_pid</i></dt>
  <dd>The process ID of the child.</dd>
  <dt><i>si_uid</i></dt>
  <dd>The real user ID of the child. (This field is not set on most other
      implementations.)</dd>
  <dt><i>si_signo</i></dt>
  <dd>Always set to <b>SIGCHLD</b>.</dd>
  <dt><i>si_status</i></dt>
  <dd>Either the exit status of the child, as given to <b>_exit</b>(2) (or
      <b>exit</b>(3)), or the signal that caused the child to terminate, stop,
      or continue. The <i>si_code</i> field can be used to determine how to
      interpret this field.</dd>
  <dt><i>si_code</i></dt>
  <dd>Set to one of: <b>CLD_EXITED</b> (child called <b>_exit</b>(2));
      <b>CLD_KILLED</b> (child killed by signal); <b>CLD_DUMPED</b> (child
      killed by signal, and dumped core); <b>CLD_STOPPED</b> (child stopped by
      signal); <b>CLD_TRAPPED</b> (traced child has trapped); or
      <b>CLD_CONTINUED</b> (child continued by <b>SIGCONT</b>).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If <b>WNOHANG</b> was specified in <i>options</i> and there were
    no children in a waitable state, then <b>waitid</b>() returns 0 immediately
    and the state of the <i>siginfo_t</i> structure pointed to by <i>infop</i>
    depends on the implementation. To (portably) distinguish this case from that
    where a child was in a waitable state, zero out the <i>si_pid</i> field
    before the call and check for a nonzero value in this field after the call
    returns.</p>
<p class="Pp">POSIX.1-2008 Technical Corrigendum 1 (2013) adds the requirement
    that when <b>WNOHANG</b> is specified in <i>options</i> and there were no
    children in a waitable state, then <b>waitid</b>() should zero out the
    <i>si_pid</i> and <i>si_signo</i> fields of the structure. On Linux and
    other implementations that adhere to this requirement, it is not necessary
    to zero out the <i>si_pid</i> field before calling <b>waitid</b>(). However,
    not all implementations follow the POSIX.1 specification on this point.</p>

A child that terminates, but has not been waited for becomes a
  &quot;zombie&quot;. The kernel maintains a minimal set of information about
  the zombie process (PID, termination status, resource usage information) in
  order to allow the parent to later perform a wait to obtain information about
  the child. As long as a zombie is not removed from the system via a wait, it
  will consume a slot in the kernel process table, and if this table fills, it
  will not be possible to create further processes. If a parent process
  terminates, then its &quot;zombie&quot; children (if any) are adopted by
  <b>init</b>(1), (or by the nearest &quot;subreaper&quot; process as defined
  through the use of the <b>prctl</b>(2) <b>PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER</b>
  operation); <b>init</b>(1) automatically performs a wait to remove the
  zombies.
<p class="Pp">POSIX.1-2001 specifies that if the disposition of <b>SIGCHLD</b>
    is set to <b>SIG_IGN</b> or the <b>SA_NOCLDWAIT</b> flag is set for
    <b>SIGCHLD</b> (see <b>sigaction</b>(2)), then children that terminate do
    not become zombies and a call to <b>wait</b>() or <b>waitpid</b>() will
    block until all children have terminated, and then fail with <i>errno</i>
    set to <b>ECHILD</b>. (The original POSIX standard left the behavior of
    setting <b>SIGCHLD</b> to <b>SIG_IGN</b> unspecified. Note that even though
    the default disposition of <b>SIGCHLD</b> is &quot;ignore&quot;, explicitly
    setting the disposition to <b>SIG_IGN</b> results in different treatment of
    zombie process children.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Linux 2.6 conforms to the POSIX requirements. However, Linux 2.4
    (and earlier) does not: if a <b>wait</b>() or <b>waitpid</b>() call is made
    while <b>SIGCHLD</b> is being ignored, the call behaves just as though
    <b>SIGCHLD</b> were not being ignored, that is, the call blocks until the
    next child terminates and then returns the process ID and status of that
    child.</p>

In the Linux kernel, a kernel-scheduled thread is not a distinct construct from
  a process. Instead, a thread is simply a process that is created using the
  Linux-unique <b>clone</b>(2) system call; other routines such as the portable
  <b>pthread_create</b>(3) call are implemented using <b>clone</b>(2). Before
  Linux 2.4, a thread was just a special case of a process, and as a consequence
  one thread could not wait on the children of another thread, even when the
  latter belongs to the same thread group. However, POSIX prescribes such
  functionality, and since Linux 2.4 a thread can, and by default will, wait on
  children of other threads in the same thread group.
<p class="Pp">The following Linux-specific <i>options</i> are for use with
    children created using <b>clone</b>(2); they can also, since Linux 4.7, be
    used with <b>waitid</b>():</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>__WCLONE</b></dt>
  <dd>Wait for &quot;clone&quot; children only. If omitted, then wait for
      &quot;non-clone&quot; children only. (A &quot;clone&quot; child is one
      which delivers no signal, or a signal other than <b>SIGCHLD</b> to its
      parent upon termination.) This option is ignored if <b>__WALL</b> is also
      specified.</dd>
  <dt><b>__WALL</b> (since Linux 2.4)</dt>
  <dd>Wait for all children, regardless of type (&quot;clone&quot; or
      &quot;non-clone&quot;).</dd>
  <dt><b>__WNOTHREAD</b> (since Linux 2.4)</dt>
  <dd>Do not wait for children of other threads in the same thread group. This
      was the default before Linux 2.4.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 4.7, the <b>__WALL</b> flag is automatically implied
    if the child is being ptraced.</p>

<b>wait</b>() is actually a library function that (in glibc) is implemented as a
  call to <b>wait4</b>(2).
<p class="Pp">On some architectures, there is no <b>waitpid</b>() system call;
    instead, this interface is implemented via a C library wrapper function that
    calls <b>wait4</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp">The raw <b>waitid</b>() system call takes a fifth argument, of
    type <i>struct rusage&#x00A0;*</i>. If this argument is non-NULL, then it is
    used to return resource usage information about the child, in the same
    manner as <b>wait4</b>(2). See <b>getrusage</b>(2) for details.</p>

According to POSIX.1-2008, an application calling <b>waitid</b>() must ensure
  that <i>infop</i> points to a <i>siginfo_t</i> structure (i.e., that it is a
  non-null pointer). On Linux, if <i>infop</i> is NULL, <b>waitid</b>()
  succeeds, and returns the process ID of the waited-for child. Applications
  should avoid relying on this inconsistent, nonstandard, and unnecessary
  feature.

The following program demonstrates the use of <b>fork</b>(2) and
  <b>waitpid</b>(). The program creates a child process. If no command-line
  argument is supplied to the program, then the child suspends its execution
  using <b>pause</b>(2), to allow the user to send signals to the child.
  Otherwise, if a command-line argument is supplied, then the child exits
  immediately, using the integer supplied on the command line as the exit
  status. The parent process executes a loop that monitors the child using
  <b>waitpid</b>(), and uses the W*() macros described above to analyze the wait
  status value.
<p class="Pp">The following shell session demonstrates the use of the
  program:</p>
