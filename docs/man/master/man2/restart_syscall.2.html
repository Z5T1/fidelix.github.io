The <b>restart_syscall</b>() system call is used to restart certain system calls
  after a process that was stopped by a signal (e.g., <b>SIGSTOP</b> or
  <b>SIGTSTP</b>) is later resumed after receiving a <b>SIGCONT</b> signal. This
  system call is designed only for internal use by the kernel.
<p class="Pp"><b>restart_syscall</b>() is used for restarting only those system
    calls that, when restarted, should adjust their time-related
    parameters&#x2014;namely <b>poll</b>(2) (since Linux 2.6.24),
    <b>nanosleep</b>(2) (since Linux 2.6), <b>clock_nanosleep</b>(2) (since
    Linux 2.6), and <b>futex</b>(2), when employed with the <b>FUTEX_WAIT</b>
    (since Linux 2.6.22) and <b>FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET</b> (since Linux 2.6.31)
    operations. <b>restart_syscall</b>() restarts the interrupted system call
    with a time argument that is suitably adjusted to account for the time that
    has already elapsed (including the time where the process was stopped by a
    signal). Without the <b>restart_syscall</b>() mechanism, restarting these
    system calls would not correctly deduct the already elapsed time when the
    process continued execution.</p>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="RETURN_VALUE"><a class="permalink" href="#RETURN_VALUE">RETURN

The return value of <b>restart_syscall</b>() is the return value of whatever
  system call is being restarted.

There is no glibc wrapper for this system call, because it is intended for use
  only by the kernel and should never be called by applications.
<p class="Pp">The kernel uses <b>restart_syscall</b>() to ensure that when a
    system call is restarted after a process has been stopped by a signal and
    then resumed by <b>SIGCONT</b>, then the time that the process spent in the
    stopped state is counted against the timeout interval specified in the
    original system call. In the case of system calls that take a timeout
    argument and automatically restart after a stop signal plus <b>SIGCONT</b>,
    but which do not have the <b>restart_syscall</b>() mechanism built in, then,
    after the process resumes execution, the time that the process spent in the
    stop state is <i>not</i> counted against the timeout value. Notable examples
    of system calls that suffer this problem are <b>ppoll</b>(2),
    <b>select</b>(2), and <b>pselect</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp">From user space, the operation of <b>restart_syscall</b>() is
    largely invisible: to the process that made the system call that is
    restarted, it appears as though that system call executed and returned in
    the usual fashion.</p>
