<b>prctl</b>() is called with a first argument describing what to do (with
  values defined in <i>&lt;linux/prctl.h&gt;</i>), and further arguments with a
  significance depending on the first one. The first argument can be:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>PR_CAP_AMBIENT</b> (since Linux 4.3)</dt>
  <dd>Reads or changes the ambient capability set of the calling thread,

</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dt><b>PR_CAP_AMBIENT_IS_SET</b></dt>
  <dd>The <b>prctl</b>() call returns 1 if the capability in <i>arg3</i> is in
      the ambient set and 0 if it is not.</dd>
  <dt><b>PR_CAP_AMBIENT_CLEAR_ALL</b></dt>
  <dd>All capabilities will be removed from the ambient set. This operation
      requires setting <i>arg3</i> to zero.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>In all of the above operations, <i>arg4</i> and <i>arg5</i> must be

      <b>cap_reset_ambient</b>(3).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>PR_CAPBSET_READ</b> (since Linux 2.6.25)</dt>
  <dd>Return (as the function result) 1 if the capability specified in
      <i>arg2</i> is in the calling thread's capability bounding set, or 0 if it
      is not. (The capability constants are defined in
      <i>&lt;linux/capability.h&gt;</i>.) The capability bounding set dictates
      whether the process can receive the capability through a file's permitted
      capability set on a subsequent call to <b>execve</b>(2).</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>PR_CAPBSET_DROP</b> (since Linux 2.6.25)</dt>
  <dd>If the calling thread has the <b>CAP_SETPCAP</b> capability within its
      user namespace, then drop the capability specified by <i>arg2</i> from the
      calling thread's capability bounding set. Any children of the calling
      thread will inherit the newly reduced bounding set.</dd>

  <dt></dt>
  <dd>A higher-level interface layered on top of this operation is provided in

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER</b> (since Linux 3.4)</dt>
  <dd>If <i>arg2</i> is nonzero, set the &quot;child subreaper&quot; attribute
      of the calling process; if <i>arg2</i> is zero, unset the attribute.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>A subreaper fulfills the role of <b>init</b>(1) for its descendant
      processes. When a process becomes orphaned (i.e., its immediate parent
      terminates), then that process will be reparented to the nearest still
      living ancestor subreaper. Subsequently, calls to <b>getppid</b>() in the
      orphaned process will now return the PID of the subreaper process, and
      when the orphan terminates, it is the subreaper process that will receive
      a <b>SIGCHLD</b> signal and will be able to <b>wait</b>(2) on the process
      to discover its termination status.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The setting of the &quot;child subreaper&quot; attribute is not inherited
      by children created by <b>fork</b>(2) and <b>clone</b>(2). The setting is
      preserved across <b>execve</b>(2).</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Establishing a subreaper process is useful in session management
      frameworks where a hierarchical group of processes is managed by a
      subreaper process that needs to be informed when one of the
      processes&#x2014;for example, a double-forked daemon&#x2014;terminates
      (perhaps so that it can restart that process). Some <b>init</b>(1)
      frameworks (e.g., <b>systemd</b>(1)) employ a subreaper process for
      similar reasons.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>PR_GET_CHILD_SUBREAPER</b> (since Linux 3.4)</dt>
  <dd>Return the &quot;child subreaper&quot; setting of the caller, in the
      location pointed to by <i>(int&#x00A0;*) arg2</i>.</dd>
  <dt><b>PR_SET_DUMPABLE</b> (since Linux 2.3.20)</dt>
  <dd>Set the state of the &quot;dumpable&quot; flag, which determines whether
      core dumps are produced for the calling process upon delivery of a signal
      whose default behavior is to produce a core dump.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>In kernels up to and including 2.6.12, <i>arg2</i> must be either 0
      (<b>SUID_DUMP_DISABLE</b>, process is not dumpable) or 1
      (<b>SUID_DUMP_USER</b>, process is dumpable). Between kernels 2.6.13 and
      2.6.17, the value 2 was also permitted, which caused any binary which
      normally would not be dumped to be dumped readable by root only; for
      security reasons, this feature has been removed. (See also the description
      of <i>/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable</i> in <b>proc</b>(5).)</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Normally, this flag is set to 1. However, it is reset to the current value
      contained in the file <i>/proc/sys/fs/suid_dumpable</i> (which by default
      has the value 0), in the following circumstances:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The process's effective user or group ID is changed.</li>
  <li>The process's filesystem user or group ID is changed (see

  <dd>Set the endian-ness of the calling process to the value given in
      <i>arg2</i>, which should be one of the following: <b>PR_ENDIAN_BIG</b>,
      <b>PR_ENDIAN_LITTLE</b>, or <b>PR_ENDIAN_PPC_LITTLE</b> (PowerPC pseudo

  <dt><b>PR_SET_FP_MODE</b> (since Linux 4.0, only on MIPS)</dt>
  <dd>On the MIPS architecture, user-space code can be built using an ABI which
      permits linking with code that has more restrictive floating-point (FP)
      requirements. For example, user-space code may be built to target the O32
      FPXX ABI and linked with code built for either one of the more restrictive
      FP32 or FP64 ABIs. When more restrictive code is linked in, the overall
      requirement for the process is to use the more restrictive floating-point
      mode.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Because the kernel has no means of knowing in advance which mode the
      process should be executed in, and because these restrictions can change
      over the lifetime of the process, the <b>PR_SET_FP_MODE</b> operation is
      provided to allow control of the floating-point mode from user space.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The <i>(unsigned int) arg2</i> argument is a bit mask describing the

      represented as a pair of registers (even- and odd- numbered, with the
      even-numbered register containing the lower 32 bits, and the odd-numbered
      register containing the higher 32 bits).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

      <b>FR=1</b> mode only.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Applications that use the O32 FP32 ABI can operate only when this bit is
      <i>unset</i> (<b>FR=0</b>; or they can be used with FRE enabled, see

      see below) can operate only when this bit is <i>set</i> (<b>FR=1</b>).

      reserved-instruction exception on every instruction that uses 32-bit
      formats and the kernel then handles the instruction in software. (The
      problem lies in the discrepancy of handling odd-numbered registers which
      are the high 32 bits of 64-bit registers with even numbers in <b>FR=0</b>
      mode and the lower 32-bit parts of odd-numbered 64-bit registers in
      <b>FR=1</b> mode.) Enabling this bit is necessary when code with the O32
      FP32 ABI should operate with code with compatible the O32 FPXX or O32
      FP64A ABIs (which require <b>FR=1</b> FPU mode) or when it is executed on

</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>MPX is a hardware-assisted mechanism for performing bounds checking on
      pointers. It consists of a set of registers storing bounds information and
      a set of special instruction prefixes that tell the CPU on which
      instructions it should do bounds enforcement. There is a limited number of
      these registers and when there are more pointers than registers, their
      contents must be &quot;spilled&quot; into a set of tables. These tables
      are called &quot;bounds tables&quot; and the MPX <b>prctl</b>() operations
      control whether the kernel manages their allocation and freeing.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>When management is enabled, the kernel will take over allocation and
      freeing of the bounds tables. It does this by trapping the #BR exceptions
      that result at first use of missing bounds tables and instead of
      delivering the exception to user space, it allocates the table and
      populates the bounds directory with the location of the new table. For
      freeing, the kernel checks to see if bounds tables are present for memory
      which is not allocated, and frees them if so.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Before enabling MPX management using <b>PR_MPX_ENABLE_MANAGEMENT</b>, the
      application must first have allocated a user-space buffer for the bounds
      directory and placed the location of that directory in the <i>bndcfgu</i>
      register.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>These calls fail if the CPU or kernel does not support MPX. Kernel support
      for MPX is enabled via the <b>CONFIG_X86_INTEL_MPX</b> configuration
      option. You can check whether the CPU supports MPX by looking for the
      'mpx' CPUID bit, like with the following command:</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    <pre>
cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep ' mpx '

    </pre>
    <br/>
  </dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>A thread may not switch in or out of long (64-bit) mode while MPX is
      enabled.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>All threads in a process are affected by these calls.</dd>

  <dd>The child of a <b>fork</b>(2) inherits the state of MPX management. During
