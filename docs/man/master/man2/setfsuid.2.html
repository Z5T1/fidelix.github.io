On Linux, a process has both a filesystem user ID and an effective user ID. The
  (Linux-specific) filesystem user ID is used for permissions checking when
  accessing filesystem objects, while the effective user ID is used for various
  other kinds of permissions checks (see <b>credentials</b>(7)).
<p class="Pp">Normally, the value of the process's filesystem user ID is the
    same as the value of its effective user ID. This is so, because whenever a
    process's effective user ID is changed, the kernel also changes the
    filesystem user ID to be the same as the new value of the effective user ID.
    A process can cause the value of its filesystem user ID to diverge from its
    effective user ID by using <b>setfsuid</b>() to change its filesystem user
    ID to the value given in <i>fsuid</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Explicit calls to <b>setfsuid</b>() and <b>setfsgid</b>(2) are
    (were) usually used only by programs such as the Linux NFS server that need
    to change what user and group ID is used for file access without a
    corresponding change in the real and effective user and group IDs. A change
    in the normal user IDs for a program such as the NFS server is (was) a
    security hole that can expose it to unwanted signals. (However, this issue
    is historical; see below.)</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>setfsuid</b>() will succeed only if the caller is the superuser
    or if <i>fsuid</i> matches either the caller's real user ID, effective user
    ID, saved set-user-ID, or current filesystem user ID.</p>

On both success and failure, this call returns the previous filesystem user ID
  of the caller.

<b>setfsuid</b>() is Linux-specific and should not be used in programs intended
  to be portable.

At the time when this system call was introduced, one process could send a
  signal to another process with the same effective user ID. This meant that if
  a privileged process changed its effective user ID for the purpose of file
  permission checking, then it could become vulnerable to receiving signals sent
  by another (unprivileged) process with the same user ID. The filesystem user
  ID attribute was thus added to allow a process to change its user ID for the
  purposes of file permission checking without at the same time becoming
  vulnerable to receiving unwanted signals. Since Linux 2.0, signal permission
  handling is different (see <b>kill</b>(2)), with the result that a process can
  change its effective user ID without being vulnerable to receiving signals
  from unwanted processes. Thus, <b>setfsuid</b>() is nowadays unneeded and
  should be avoided in new applications (likewise for <b>setfsgid</b>(2)).
<p class="Pp">The original Linux <b>setfsuid</b>() system call supported only
    16-bit user IDs. Subsequently, Linux 2.4 added <b>setfsuid32</b>()
    supporting 32-bit IDs. The glibc <b>setfsuid</b>() wrapper function
    transparently deals with the variation across kernel versions.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="C_library/kernel_differences"><a class="permalink" href="#C_library/kernel_differences">C
  library/kernel differences</a></h2>
In glibc 2.15 and earlier, when the wrapper for this system call determines that
  the argument can't be passed to the kernel without integer truncation (because
  the kernel is old and does not support 32-bit user IDs), it will return -1 and
  set <i>errno</i> to <b>EINVAL</b> without attempting the system call.

No error indications of any kind are returned to the caller, and the fact that
  both successful and unsuccessful calls return the same value makes it
  impossible to directly determine whether the call succeeded or failed.
  Instead, the caller must resort to looking at the return value from a further
  call such as <i>setfsuid(-1)</i> (which will always fail), in order to
  determine if a preceding call to <b>setfsuid</b>() changed the filesystem user
  ID. At the very least, <b>EPERM</b> should be returned when the call fails
  (because the caller lacks the <b>CAP_SETUID</b> capability).
