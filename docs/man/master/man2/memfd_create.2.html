<b>memfd_create</b>() creates an anonymous file and returns a file descriptor
  that refers to it. The file behaves like a regular file, and so can be
  modified, truncated, memory-mapped, and so on. However, unlike a regular file,
  it lives in RAM and has a volatile backing storage. Once all references to the
  file are dropped, it is automatically released. Anonymous memory is used for
  all backing pages of the file. Therefore, files created by
  <b>memfd_create</b>() have the same semantics as other anonymous memory
  allocations such as those allocated using <b>mmap</b>(2) with the
  <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b> flag.
<p class="Pp">The initial size of the file is set to 0. Following the call, the
    file size should be set using <b>ftruncate</b>(2). (Alternatively, the file
    may be populated by calls to <b>write</b>(2) or similar.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The name supplied in <i>name</i> is used as a filename and will be
    displayed as the target of the corresponding symbolic link in the directory
    <i>/proc/self/fd/</i>. The displayed name is always prefixed with
    <i>memfd:</i> and serves only for debugging purposes. Names do not affect
    the behavior of the file descriptor, and as such multiple files can have the
    same name without any side effects.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following values may be bitwise ORed in <i>flags</i> to change
    the behavior of <b>memfd_create</b>():</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>MFD_CLOEXEC</b></dt>
  <dd>Set the close-on-exec (<b>FD_CLOEXEC</b>) flag on the new file descriptor.
      See the description of the <b>O_CLOEXEC</b> flag in <b>open</b>(2) for
      reasons why this may be useful.</dd>
  <dt><b>MFD_ALLOW_SEALING</b></dt>
  <dd>Allow sealing operations on this file. See the discussion of the
      <b>F_ADD_SEALS</b> and <b>F_GET_SEALS</b> operations in <b>fcntl</b>(2),
      and also NOTES, below. The initial set of seals is empty. If this flag is
      not set, the initial set of seals will be <b>F_SEAL_SEAL</b>, meaning that
      no other seals can be set on the file.</dd>
  <dt><b>MFD_HUGETLB</b> (since Linux 4.14)</dt>
  <dd>The anonymous file will be created in the hugetlbfs filesystem using huge
      pages. See the Linux kernel source file
      <i>Documentation/admin-guide/mm/hugetlbpage.rst</i> for more information
      about hugetlbfs. Specifying both <b>MFD_HUGETLB</b> and
      <b>MFD_ALLOW_SEALING</b> in <i>flags</i> is supported since Linux
    4.16.</dd>

<p class="Pp">Unused bits in <i>flags</i> must be 0.</p>
<p class="Pp">As its return value, <b>memfd_create</b>() returns a new file
    descriptor that can be used to refer to the file. This file descriptor is
    opened for both reading and writing (<b>O_RDWR</b>) and <b>O_LARGEFILE</b>
    is set for the file descriptor.</p>
<p class="Pp">With respect to <b>fork</b>(2) and <b>execve</b>(2), the usual
    semantics apply for the file descriptor created by <b>memfd_create</b>(). A
    copy of the file descriptor is inherited by the child produced by
    <b>fork</b>(2) and refers to the same file. The file descriptor is preserved
    across <b>execve</b>(2), unless the close-on-exec flag has been set.</p>

The <b>memfd_create</b>() system call first appeared in Linux 3.17; glibc
  support was added in version 2.27.

The <b>memfd_create</b>() system call is Linux-specific.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
The <b>memfd_create</b>() system call provides a simple alternative to manually
  mounting a <b>tmpfs</b>(5) filesystem and creating and opening a file in that
  filesystem. The primary purpose of <b>memfd_create</b>() is to create files
  and associated file descriptors that are used with the file-sealing APIs
  provided by <b>fcntl</b>(2).
<p class="Pp">The <b>memfd_create</b>() system call also has uses without file
    sealing (which is why file-sealing is disabled, unless explicitly requested
    with the <b>MFD_ALLOW_SEALING</b> flag). In particular, it can be used as an
    alternative to creating files in <i>tmp</i> or as an alternative to using
    the <b>open</b>(2) <b>O_TMPFILE</b> in cases where there is no intention to
    actually link the resulting file into the filesystem.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="File_sealing"><a class="permalink" href="#File_sealing">File
  sealing</a></h2>
In the absence of file sealing, processes that communicate via shared memory
  must either trust each other, or take measures to deal with the possibility
  that an untrusted peer may manipulate the shared memory region in problematic
  ways. For example, an untrusted peer might modify the contents of the shared
  memory at any time, or shrink the shared memory region. The former possibility
  leaves the local process vulnerable to time-of-check-to-time-of-use race
  conditions (typically dealt with by copying data from the shared memory region
  before checking and using it). The latter possibility leaves the local process
  vulnerable to <b>SIGBUS</b> signals when an attempt is made to access a
  now-nonexistent location in the shared memory region. (Dealing with this
  possibility necessitates the use of a handler for the <b>SIGBUS</b> signal.)
<p class="Pp">Dealing with untrusted peers imposes extra complexity on code that
    employs shared memory. Memory sealing enables that extra complexity to be
    eliminated, by allowing a process to operate secure in the knowledge that
    its peer can't modify the shared memory in an undesired fashion.</p>
<p class="Pp">An example of the usage of the sealing mechanism is as
  follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>The first process creates a <b>tmpfs</b>(5) file using
      <b>memfd_create</b>(). The call yields a file descriptor used in
      subsequent steps.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>The first process sizes the file created in the previous step using
      <b>ftruncate</b>(2), maps it using <b>mmap</b>(2), and populates the
      shared memory with the desired data.</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>The first process uses the <b>fcntl</b>(2) <b>F_ADD_SEALS</b> operation to
      place one or more seals on the file, in order to restrict further
      modifications on the file. (If placing the seal <b>F_SEAL_WRITE</b>, then
      it will be necessary to first unmap the shared writable mapping created in
      the previous step. Otherwise, behavior similar to <b>F_SEAL_WRITE</b> can
      be achieved by using <b>F_SEAL_FUTURE_WRITE</b>, which will prevent future
      writes via <b>mmap</b>(2) and <b>write</b>(2) from succeeding while
      keeping existing shared writable mappings).</dd>
  <dt>4.</dt>
  <dd>A second process obtains a file descriptor for the <b>tmpfs</b>(5) file
      and maps it. Among the possible ways in which this could happen are the
      following:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The process that called <b>memfd_create</b>() could transfer the resulting
      file descriptor to the second process via a UNIX domain socket (see
      <b>unix</b>(7) and <b>cmsg</b>(3)). The second process then maps the file
      using <b>mmap</b>(2).</li>
  <li>The second process is created via <b>fork</b>(2) and thus automatically
      inherits the file descriptor and mapping. (Note that in this case and the
      next, there is a natural trust relationship between the two processes,
      since they are running under the same user ID. Therefore, file sealing
      would not normally be necessary.)</li>
  <li>The second process opens the file <i>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/fd/&lt;fd&gt;</i>,
      where <i>&lt;pid&gt;</i> is the PID of the first process (the one that
      called <b>memfd_create</b>()), and <i>&lt;fd&gt;</i> is the number of the
      file descriptor returned by the call to <b>memfd_create</b>() in that
      process. The second process then maps the file using <b>mmap</b>(2).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>5.</dt>
  <dd>The second process uses the <b>fcntl</b>(2) <b>F_GET_SEALS</b> operation
      to retrieve the bit mask of seals that has been applied to the file. This
      bit mask can be inspected in order to determine what kinds of restrictions
      have been placed on file modifications. If desired, the second process can
      apply further seals to impose additional restrictions (so long as the
      <b>F_SEAL_SEAL</b> seal has not yet been applied).</dd>
</dl>

<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLE"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLE">EXAMPLE</a></h1>
Below are shown two example programs that demonstrate the use of
  <b>memfd_create</b>() and the file sealing API.
<p class="Pp">The first program, <i>t_memfd_create.c</i>, creates a
    <b>tmpfs</b>(5) file using <b>memfd_create</b>(), sets a size for the file,
    maps it into memory, and optionally places some seals on the file. The
    program accepts up to three command-line arguments, of which the first two
    are required. The first argument is the name to associate with the file, the
    second argument is the size to be set for the file, and the optional third
    argument is a string of characters that specify seals to be set on file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second program, <i>t_get_seals.c</i>, can be used to open an
    existing file that was created via <b>memfd_create</b>() and inspect the set
    of seals that have been applied to that file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following shell session demonstrates the use of these
    programs. First we create a <b>tmpfs</b>(5) file and set some seals on
  it:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>./t_memfd_create my_memfd_file 4096 sw &amp;</b>
[1] 11775
PID: 11775; fd: 3; /proc/11775/fd/3

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">At this point, the <i>t_memfd_create</i> program continues to run
    in the background. From another program, we can obtain a file descriptor for
    the file created by <b>memfd_create</b>() by opening the
    <i>/proc/[pid]/fd</i> file that corresponds to the file descriptor opened by
    <b>memfd_create</b>(). Using that pathname, we inspect the content of the
    <i>/proc/[pid]/fd</i> symbolic link, and use our <i>t_get_seals</i> program
    to view the seals that have been placed on the file:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>readlink /proc/11775/fd/3</b>
/memfd:my_memfd_file (deleted)
$ <b>./t_get_seals /proc/11775/fd/3</b>
Existing seals: WRITE SHRINK
