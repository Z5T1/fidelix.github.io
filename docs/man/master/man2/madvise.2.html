The <b>madvise</b>() system call is used to give advice or directions to the
  kernel about the address range beginning at address <i>addr</i> and with size
  <i>length</i> bytes In most cases, the goal of such advice is to improve
  system or application performance.
<p class="Pp">Initially, the system call supported a set of
    &quot;conventional&quot; <i>advice</i> values, which are also available on
    several other implementations. (Note, though, that <b>madvise</b>() is not
    specified in POSIX.) Subsequently, a number of Linux-specific <i>advice</i>
    values have been added.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Conventional_advice_values"><a class="permalink" href="#Conventional_advice_values">Conventional
  advice values</a></h2>
The <i>advice</i> values listed below allow an application to tell the kernel
  how it expects to use some mapped or shared memory areas, so that the kernel
  can choose appropriate read-ahead and caching techniques. These <i>advice</i>
  values do not influence the semantics of the application (except in the case
  of <b>MADV_DONTNEED</b>), but may influence its performance. All of the
  <i>advice</i> values listed here have analogs in the POSIX-specified
  <b>posix_madvise</b>(3) function, and the values have the same meanings, with
  the exception of <b>MADV_DONTNEED</b>.
<p class="Pp">The advice is indicated in the <i>advice</i> argument, which is
    one of the following:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>MADV_NORMAL</b></dt>
  <dd>No special treatment. This is the default.</dd>
  <dt><b>MADV_RANDOM</b></dt>
  <dd>Expect page references in random order. (Hence, read ahead may be less
      useful than normally.)</dd>
  <dt><b>MADV_SEQUENTIAL</b></dt>
  <dd>Expect page references in sequential order. (Hence, pages in the given
      range can be aggressively read ahead, and may be freed soon after they are
      accessed.)</dd>
  <dt><b>MADV_WILLNEED</b></dt>
  <dd>Expect access in the near future. (Hence, it might be a good idea to read
      some pages ahead.)</dd>
  <dt><b>MADV_DONTNEED</b></dt>
  <dd>Do not expect access in the near future. (For the time being, the
      application is finished with the given range, so the kernel can free
      resources associated with it.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>After a successful <b>MADV_DONTNEED</b> operation, the semantics of memory
      access in the specified region are changed: subsequent accesses of pages
      in the range will succeed, but will result in either repopulating the
      memory contents from the up-to-date contents of the underlying mapped file
      (for shared file mappings, shared anonymous mappings, and shmem-based
      techniques such as System V shared memory segments) or zero-fill-on-demand
      pages for anonymous private mappings.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Note that, when applied to shared mappings, <b>MADV_DONTNEED</b> might not
      lead to immediate freeing of the pages in the range. The kernel is free to
      delay freeing the pages until an appropriate moment. The resident set size
      (RSS) of the calling process will be immediately reduced however.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><b>MADV_DONTNEED</b> cannot be applied to locked pages, Huge TLB pages, or
      <b>VM_PFNMAP</b> pages. (Pages marked with the kernel-internal
      <b>VM_PFNMAP</b> flag are special memory areas that are not managed by the
      virtual memory subsystem. Such pages are typically created by device
      drivers that map the pages into user space.)</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Linux-specific_advice_values"><a class="permalink" href="#Linux-specific_advice_values">Linux-specific
  advice values</a></h2>
The following Linux-specific <i>advice</i> values have no counterparts in the
  POSIX-specified <b>posix_madvise</b>(3), and may or may not have counterparts
  in the <b>madvise</b>() interface available on other implementations. Note
  that some of these operations change the semantics of memory accesses.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>MADV_REMOVE</b> (since Linux 2.6.16)</dt>
  <dd>Free up a given range of pages and its associated backing store. This is
      equivalent to punching a hole in the corresponding byte range of the
      backing store (see <b>fallocate</b>(2)). Subsequent accesses in the
      specified address range will see bytes containing zero.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The specified address range must be mapped shared and writable. This flag
      cannot be applied to locked pages, Huge TLB pages, or <b>VM_PFNMAP</b>
      pages.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>In the initial implementation, only <b>tmpfs</b>(5) was supported
      <b>MADV_REMOVE</b>; but since Linux 3.5, any filesystem which supports the
      <b>fallocate</b>(2) <b>FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE</b> mode also supports
      <b>MADV_REMOVE</b>. Hugetlbfs fails with the error <b>EINVAL</b> and other
      filesystems fail with the error <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>MADV_DONTFORK</b> (since Linux 2.6.16)</dt>
  <dd>Do not make the pages in this range available to the child after a
      <b>fork</b>(2). This is useful to prevent copy-on-write semantics from
      changing the physical location of a page if the parent writes to it after
      a <b>fork</b>(2). (Such page relocations cause problems for hardware that
      DMAs into the page.)</dd>
  <dt><b>MADV_DOFORK</b> (since Linux 2.6.16)</dt>
  <dd>Undo the effect of <b>MADV_DONTFORK</b>, restoring the default behavior,
      whereby a mapping is inherited across <b>fork</b>(2).</dd>
  <dt><b>MADV_HWPOISON</b> (since Linux 2.6.32)</dt>
  <dd>Poison the pages in the range specified by <i>addr</i> and <i>length</i>
      and handle subsequent references to those pages like a hardware memory
      corruption. This operation is available only for privileged
      (<b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b>) processes. This operation may result in the calling
      process receiving a <b>SIGBUS</b> and the page being unmapped.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>This feature is intended for testing of memory error-handling code; it is
      available only if the kernel was configured with
      <b>CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>MADV_MERGEABLE</b> (since Linux 2.6.32)</dt>
  <dd>Enable Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM) for the pages in the range specified
      by <i>addr</i> and <i>length</i>. The kernel regularly scans those areas
      of user memory that have been marked as mergeable, looking for pages with
      identical content. These are replaced by a single write-protected page
      (which is automatically copied if a process later wants to update the
      content of the page). KSM merges only private anonymous pages (see
      <b>mmap</b>(2)).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The KSM feature is intended for applications that generate many instances
      of the same data (e.g., virtualization systems such as KVM). It can
      consume a lot of processing power; use with care. See the Linux kernel
      source file <i>Documentation/admin-guide/mm/ksm.rst</i> for more
    details.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The <b>MADV_MERGEABLE</b> and <b>MADV_UNMERGEABLE</b> operations are
      available only if the kernel was configured with <b>CONFIG_KSM</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>MADV_UNMERGEABLE</b> (since Linux 2.6.32)</dt>
  <dd>Undo the effect of an earlier <b>MADV_MERGEABLE</b> operation on the
      specified address range; KSM unmerges whatever pages it had merged in the
      address range specified by <i>addr</i> and <i>length</i>.</dd>
  <dt><b>MADV_SOFT_OFFLINE</b> (since Linux 2.6.33)</dt>
  <dd>Soft offline the pages in the range specified by <i>addr</i> and
      <i>length</i>. The memory of each page in the specified range is preserved
      (i.e., when next accessed, the same content will be visible, but in a new
      physical page frame), and the original page is offlined (i.e., no longer
      used, and taken out of normal memory management). The effect of the
      <b>MADV_SOFT_OFFLINE</b> operation is invisible to (i.e., does not change
      the semantics of) the calling process.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>This feature is intended for testing of memory error-handling code; it is
      available only if the kernel was configured with
      <b>CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>MADV_HUGEPAGE</b> (since Linux 2.6.38)</dt>
  <dd>Enable Transparent Huge Pages (THP) for pages in the range specified by
      <i>addr</i> and <i>length</i>. Currently, Transparent Huge Pages work only
      with private anonymous pages (see <b>mmap</b>(2)). The kernel will
      regularly scan the areas marked as huge page candidates to replace them
      with huge pages. The kernel will also allocate huge pages directly when
      the region is naturally aligned to the huge page size (see
      <b>posix_memalign</b>(2)).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>This feature is primarily aimed at applications that use large mappings of
      data and access large regions of that memory at a time (e.g.,
      virtualization systems such as QEMU). It can very easily waste memory
      (e.g., a 2&#x00A0;MB mapping that only ever accesses 1 byte will result in
      2&#x00A0;MB of wired memory instead of one 4&#x00A0;KB page). See the
      Linux kernel source file <i>Documentation/admin-guide/mm/transhuge.rst</i>
      for more details.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The <b>MADV_HUGEPAGE</b> and <b>MADV_NOHUGEPAGE</b> operations are
      available only if the kernel was configured with
      <b>CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>MADV_NOHUGEPAGE</b> (since Linux 2.6.38)</dt>
  <dd>Ensures that memory in the address range specified by <i>addr</i> and
      <i>length</i> will not be collapsed into huge pages.</dd>
  <dt><b>MADV_DONTDUMP</b> (since Linux 3.4)</dt>
  <dd>Exclude from a core dump those pages in the range specified by <i>addr</i>
      and <i>length</i>. This is useful in applications that have large areas of
      memory that are known not to be useful in a core dump. The effect of
      <b>MADV_DONTDUMP</b> takes precedence over the bit mask that is set via
      the <i>/proc/[pid]/coredump_filter</i> file (see <b>core</b>(5)).</dd>
  <dt><b>MADV_DODUMP</b> (since Linux 3.4)</dt>
  <dd>Undo the effect of an earlier <b>MADV_DONTDUMP</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>MADV_FREE</b> (since Linux 4.5)</dt>
  <dd>The application no longer requires the pages in the range specified by
      <i>addr</i> and <i>len</i>. The kernel can thus free these pages, but the
      freeing could be delayed until memory pressure occurs. For each of the
      pages that has been marked to be freed but has not yet been freed, the
      free operation will be canceled if the caller writes into the page. After
      a successful <b>MADV_FREE</b> operation, any stale data (i.e., dirty,
      unwritten pages) will be lost when the kernel frees the pages. However,
      subsequent writes to pages in the range will succeed and then kernel
      cannot free those dirtied pages, so that the caller can always see just
      written data. If there is no subsequent write, the kernel can free the
      pages at any time. Once pages in the range have been freed, the caller
      will see zero-fill-on-demand pages upon subsequent page references.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The <b>MADV_FREE</b> operation can be applied only to private anonymous
      pages (see <b>mmap</b>(2)). In Linux before version 4.12, when freeing
      pages on a swapless system, the pages in the given range are freed
      instantly, regardless of memory pressure.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>MADV_WIPEONFORK</b> (since Linux 4.14)</dt>
  <dd>Present the child process with zero-filled memory in this range after a
      <b>fork</b>(2). This is useful in forking servers in order to ensure that
      sensitive per-process data (for example, PRNG seeds, cryptographic
      secrets, and so on) is not handed to child processes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
