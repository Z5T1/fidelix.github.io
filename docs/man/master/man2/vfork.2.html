(From POSIX.1) The <b>vfork</b>() function has the same effect as
  <b>fork</b>(2), except that the behavior is undefined if the process created
  by <b>vfork</b>() either modifies any data other than a variable of type
  <i>pid_t</i> used to store the return value from <b>vfork</b>(), or returns
  from the function in which <b>vfork</b>() was called, or calls any other
  function before successfully calling <b>_exit</b>(2) or one of the
  <b>exec</b>(3) family of functions.

<b>vfork</b>(), just like <b>fork</b>(2), creates a child process of the calling
  process. For details and return value and errors, see <b>fork</b>(2).
<p class="Pp"><b>vfork</b>() is a special case of <b>clone</b>(2). It is used to
    create new processes without copying the page tables of the parent process.
    It may be useful in performance-sensitive applications where a child is
    created which then immediately issues an <b>execve</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>vfork</b>() differs from <b>fork</b>(2) in that the calling
    thread is suspended until the child terminates (either normally, by calling
    <b>_exit</b>(2), or abnormally, after delivery of a fatal signal), or it
    makes a call to <b>execve</b>(2). Until that point, the child shares all
    memory with its parent, including the stack. The child must not return from
    the current function or call <b>exit</b>(3) (which would have the effect of
    calling exit handlers established by the parent process and flushing the
    parent's <b>stdio</b>(3) buffers), but may call <b>_exit</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp">As with <b>fork</b>(2), the child process created by
    <b>vfork</b>() inherits copies of various of the caller's process attributes
    (e.g., file descriptors, signal dispositions, and current working
    directory); the <b>vfork</b>() call differs only in the treatment of the
    virtual address space, as described above.</p>
<p class="Pp">Signals sent to the parent arrive after the child releases the
    parent's memory (i.e., after the child terminates or calls
    <b>execve</b>(2)).</p>

Under Linux, <b>fork</b>(2) is implemented using copy-on-write pages, so the
  only penalty incurred by <b>fork</b>(2) is the time and memory required to
  duplicate the parent's page tables, and to create a unique task structure for
  the child. However, in the bad old days a <b>fork</b>(2) would require making
  a complete copy of the caller's data space, often needlessly, since usually
  immediately afterward an <b>exec</b>(3) is done. Thus, for greater efficiency,
  BSD introduced the <b>vfork</b>() system call, which did not fully copy the
  address space of the parent process, but borrowed the parent's memory and
  thread of control until a call to <b>execve</b>(2) or an exit occurred. The
  parent process was suspended while the child was using its resources. The use
  of <b>vfork</b>() was tricky: for example, not modifying data in the parent
  process depended on knowing which variables were held in a register.

4.3BSD; POSIX.1-2001 (but marked OBSOLETE). POSIX.1-2008 removes the
  specification of <b>vfork</b>().
<p class="Pp">The requirements put on <b>vfork</b>() by the standards are weaker
    than those put on <b>fork</b>(2), so an implementation where the two are
    synonymous is compliant. In particular, the programmer cannot rely on the
    parent remaining blocked until the child either terminates or calls
    <b>execve</b>(2), and cannot rely on any specific behavior with respect to
    shared memory.</p>

Some consider the semantics of <b>vfork</b>() to be an architectural blemish,
  and the 4.2BSD man page stated: &quot;This system call will be eliminated when
  proper system sharing mechanisms are implemented. Users should not depend on
  the memory sharing semantics of <b>vfork</b>() as it will, in that case, be
  made synonymous to <b>fork</b>(2).&quot; However, even though modern memory
  management hardware has decreased the performance difference between
  <b>fork</b>(2) and <b>vfork</b>(), there are various reasons why Linux and
  other systems have retained <b>vfork</b>():
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Some performance-critical applications require the small performance
      advantage conferred by <b>vfork</b>().</li>
  <li><b>vfork</b>() can be implemented on systems that lack a memory-management
      unit (MMU), but <b>fork</b>(2) can't be implemented on such systems.
      (POSIX.1-2008 removed <b>vfork</b>() from the standard; the POSIX
      rationale for the <b>posix_spawn</b>(3) function notes that that function,
      which provides functionality equivalent to <b>fork</b>(2)+<b>exec</b>(3),
      is designed to be implementable on systems that lack an MMU.)</li>
  <li>On systems where memory is constrained, <b>vfork</b>() avoids the need to
      temporarily commit memory (see the description of
      <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</i> in <b>proc</b>(5)) in order to
      execute a new program. (This can be especially beneficial where a large
      parent process wishes to execute a small helper program in a child
      process.) By contrast, using <b>fork</b>(2) in this scenario requires
      either committing an amount of memory equal to the size of the parent
      process (if strict overcommitting is in force) or overcommitting memory
      with the risk that a process is terminated by the out-of-memory (OOM)
      killer.</li>
</ul>

The child process should take care not to modify the memory in unintended ways,
  since such changes will be seen by the parent process once the child
  terminates or executes another program. In this regard, signal handlers can be
  especially problematic: if a signal handler that is invoked in the child of
  <b>vfork</b>() changes memory, those changes may result in an inconsistent
  process state from the perspective of the parent process (e.g., memory changes
  would be visible in the parent, but changes to the state of open file
  descriptors would not be visible).
<p class="Pp">When <b>vfork</b>() is called in a multithreaded process, only the
    calling thread is suspended until the child terminates or executes a new
    program. This means that the child is sharing an address space with other
    running code. This can be dangerous if another thread in the parent process
    changes credentials (using <b>setuid</b>(2) or similar), since there are now
    two processes with different privilege levels running in the same address
    space. As an example of the dangers, suppose that a multithreaded program
    running as root creates a child using <b>vfork</b>(). After the
    <b>vfork</b>(), a thread in the parent process drops the process to an
    unprivileged user in order to run some untrusted code (e.g., perhaps via
    plug-in opened with <b>dlopen</b>(3)). In this case, attacks are possible
    where the parent process uses <b>mmap</b>(2) to map in code that will be
    executed by the privileged child process.</p>

Fork handlers established using <b>pthread_atfork</b>(3) are not called when a
  multithreaded program employing the NPTL threading library calls
  <b>vfork</b>(). Fork handlers are called in this case in a program using the
  LinuxThreads threading library. (See <b>pthreads</b>(7) for a description of
  Linux threading libraries.)
<p class="Pp">A call to <b>vfork</b>() is equivalent to calling <b>clone</b>(2)
    with <i>flags</i> specified as:</p>

The <b>vfork</b>() system call appeared in 3.0BSD. In 4.4BSD it was made
  synonymous to <b>fork</b>(2) but NetBSD introduced it again; see
  <a class="Lk" href="http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/kernel/vfork.html">http://www.netbsd.org/Documentation/kernel/vfork.html</a>.
  In Linux, it has been equivalent to <b>fork</b>(2) until 2.2.0-pre6 or so.
  Since 2.2.0-pre9 (on i386, somewhat later on other architectures) it is an
  independent system call. Support was added in glibc 2.0.112.

Details of the signal handling are obscure and differ between systems. The BSD
  man page states: &quot;To avoid a possible deadlock situation, processes that
  are children in the middle of a <b>vfork</b>() are never sent <b>SIGTTOU</b>
  or <b>SIGTTIN</b> signals; rather, output or <i>ioctl</i>s are allowed and
  input attempts result in an end-of-file indication.&quot;
