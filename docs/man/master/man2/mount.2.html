<b>mount</b>() attaches the filesystem specified by <i>source</i> (which is
  often a pathname referring to a device, but can also be the pathname of a
  directory or file, or a dummy string) to the location (a directory or file)
  specified by the pathname in <i>target</i>.
<p class="Pp">Appropriate privilege (Linux: the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> capability)
    is required to mount filesystems.</p>
<p class="Pp">Values for the <i>filesystemtype</i> argument supported by the
    kernel are listed in <i>/proc/filesystems</i> (e.g., &quot;btrfs&quot;,
    &quot;ext4&quot;, &quot;jfs&quot;, &quot;xfs&quot;, &quot;vfat&quot;,
    &quot;fuse&quot;, &quot;tmpfs&quot;, &quot;cgroup&quot;, &quot;proc&quot;,
    &quot;mqueue&quot;, &quot;nfs&quot;, &quot;cifs&quot;, &quot;iso9660&quot;).
    Further types may become available when the appropriate modules are
  loaded.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>data</i> argument is interpreted by the different
    filesystems. Typically it is a string of comma-separated options understood
    by this filesystem. See <b>mount</b>(8) for details of the options available
    for each filesystem type.</p>
<p class="Pp">A call to <b>mount</b>() performs one of a number of general types
    of operation, depending on the bits specified in <i>mountflags</i>. The
    choice of which operation to perform is determined by testing the bits set
    in <i>mountflags</i>, with the tests being conducted in the order listed
    here:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Remount an existing mount: <i>mountflags</i> includes
    <b>MS_REMOUNT</b>.</li>
  <li>Create a bind mount: <i>mountflags</i> includes <b>MS_BIND</b>.</li>
  <li>Change the propagation type of an existing mount: <i>mountflags</i>
      includes one of <b>MS_SHARED</b>, <b>MS_PRIVATE</b>, <b>MS_SLAVE</b>, or
      <b>MS_UNBINDABLE</b>.</li>
  <li>Move an existing mount to a new location: <i>mountflags</i> includes
      <b>MS_MOVE</b>.</li>
  <li>Create a new mount: <i>mountflags</i> includes none of the above
    flags.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Each of these operations is detailed later in this page. Further
    flags may be specified in <i>mountflags</i> to modify the behavior of
    <b>mount</b>(), as described below.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Additional_mount_flags"><a class="permalink" href="#Additional_mount_flags">Additional
  mount flags</a></h2>
The list below describes the additional flags that can be specified in
  <i>mountflags</i>. Note that some operation types ignore some or all of these
  flags, as described later in this page.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>MS_DIRSYNC</b> (since Linux 2.5.19)</dt>
  <dd>Make directory changes on this filesystem synchronous. (This property can
      be obtained for individual directories or subtrees using
      <b>chattr</b>(1).)</dd>
  <dt><b>MS_LAZYTIME</b> (since Linux 4.0)</dt>
  <dd>Reduce on-disk updates of inode timestamps (atime, mtime, ctime) by
      maintaining these changes only in memory. The on-disk timestamps are
      updated only when:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">

      <b>sync</b>(2);</dd>
  <dt>(c)</dt>
  <dd>an undeleted inode is evicted from memory; or</dd>
  <dt>(d)</dt>
  <dd>more than 24 hours have passed since the inode was written to disk.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>This mount option significantly reduces writes needed to update the
      inode's timestamps, especially mtime and atime. However, in the event of a
      system crash, the atime and mtime fields on disk might be out of date by
      up to 24 hours.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Examples of workloads where this option could be of significant benefit
      include frequent random writes to preallocated files, as well as cases
      where the <b>MS_STRICTATIME</b> mount option is also enabled. (The
      advantage of combining <b>MS_STRICTATIME</b> and <b>MS_LAZYTIME</b> is
      that <b>stat</b>(2) will return the correctly updated atime, but the atime
      updates will be flushed to disk only in the cases listed above.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>MS_MANDLOCK</b></dt>
  <dd>Permit mandatory locking on files in this filesystem. (Mandatory locking
      must still be enabled on a per-file basis, as described in
      <b>fcntl</b>(2).) Since Linux 4.5, this mount option requires the
      <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> capability and a kernel configured with the
      <b>CONFIG_MANDATORY_FILE_LOCKING</b> option.</dd>
  <dt><b>MS_NOATIME</b></dt>
  <dd>Do not update access times for (all types of) files on this
    filesystem.</dd>
  <dt><b>MS_NODEV</b></dt>
  <dd>Do not allow access to devices (special files) on this filesystem.</dd>
  <dt><b>MS_NODIRATIME</b></dt>
  <dd>Do not update access times for directories on this filesystem. This flag
      provides a subset of the functionality provided by <b>MS_NOATIME</b>; that
      is, <b>MS_NOATIME</b> implies <b>MS_NODIRATIME</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>MS_NOEXEC</b></dt>
  <dd>Do not allow programs to be executed from this filesystem.</dd>
  <dt><b>MS_NOSUID</b></dt>
  <dd>Do not honor set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits or file capabilities when
      executing programs from this filesystem.</dd>
  <dt><b>MS_RDONLY</b></dt>
  <dd>Mount filesystem read-only.</dd>
  <dt><b>MS_REC</b> (since Linux 2.4.11)</dt>
  <dd>Used in conjunction with <b>MS_BIND</b> to create a recursive bind mount,
      and in conjunction with the propagation type flags to recursively change
      the propagation type of all of the mounts in a subtree. See below for
      further details.</dd>
  <dt><b>MS_RELATIME</b> (since Linux 2.6.20)</dt>
  <dd>When a file on this filesystem is accessed, update the file's last access
      time (atime) only if the current value of atime is less than or equal to
      the file's last modification time (mtime) or last status change time
      (ctime). This option is useful for programs, such as <b>mutt</b>(1), that
      need to know when a file has been read since it was last modified. Since
      Linux 2.6.30, the kernel defaults to the behavior provided by this flag
      (unless <b>MS_NOATIME</b> was specified), and the <b>MS_STRICTATIME</b>
      flag is required to obtain traditional semantics. In addition, since Linux
      2.6.30, the file's last access time is always updated if it is more than 1
      day old.</dd>
  <dt><b>MS_SILENT</b> (since Linux 2.6.17)</dt>
  <dd>Suppress the display of certain (<i>printk</i>()) warning messages in the
      kernel log. This flag supersedes the misnamed and obsolete
      <b>MS_VERBOSE</b> flag (available since Linux 2.4.12), which has the same
      meaning.</dd>
  <dt><b>MS_STRICTATIME</b> (since Linux 2.6.30)</dt>
  <dd>Always update the last access time (atime) when files on this filesystem
      are accessed. (This was the default behavior before Linux 2.6.30.)
      Specifying this flag overrides the effect of setting the <b>MS_NOATIME</b>
      and <b>MS_RELATIME</b> flags.</dd>
  <dt><b>MS_SYNCHRONOUS</b></dt>
  <dd>Make writes on this filesystem synchronous (as though the <b>O_SYNC</b>
      flag to <b>open</b>(2) was specified for all file opens to this
      filesystem).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">From Linux 2.4 onward, some of the above flags are settable on a
    per-mount basis, while others apply to the superblock of the mounted
    filesystem, meaning that all mounts of the same filesystem share those
    flags. (Previously, all of the flags were per-superblock.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The per-mount-point flags are as follows:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Since Linux 2.4: <b>MS_NODEV</b>, <b>MS_NOEXEC</b>, and <b>MS_NOSUID</b>
      flags are settable on a per-mount-point basis.</li>
  <li>Since Linux 2.6.16: <b>MS_NOATIME</b> and <b>MS_NODIRATIME</b>.</li>
  <li>Since Linux 2.6.20: <b>MS_RELATIME</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">The following flags are per-superblock: <b>MS_DIRSYNC</b>,
    <b>MS_LAZYTIME</b>, <b>MS_MANDLOCK</b>, <b>MS_SILENT</b>, and
    <b>MS_SYNCHRONOUS</b>. The initial settings of these flags are determined on
    the first mount of the filesystem, and will be shared by all subsequent
    mounts of the same filesystem. Subsequently, the settings of the flags can
    be changed via a remount operation (see below). Such changes will be visible
    via all mount points associated with the filesystem.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 2.6.16, <b>MS_RDONLY</b> can be set or cleared on a
    per-mount-point basis as well as on the underlying filesystem superblock.
    The mounted filesystem will be writable only if neither the filesystem nor
    the mountpoint are flagged as read-only.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Remounting_an_existing_mount"><a class="permalink" href="#Remounting_an_existing_mount">Remounting
  an existing mount</a></h2>
An existing mount may be remounted by specifying <b>MS_REMOUNT</b> in
  <i>mountflags</i>. This allows you to change the <i>mountflags</i> and
  <i>data</i> of an existing mount without having to unmount and remount the
  filesystem. <i>target</i> should be the same value specified in the initial
  <b>mount</b>() call.
<p class="Pp">The <i>source</i> and <i>filesystemtype</i> arguments are
  ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>mountflags</i> and <i>data</i> arguments should match the
    values used in the original <b>mount</b>() call, except for those parameters
    that are being deliberately changed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following <i>mountflags</i> can be changed:
    <b>MS_LAZYTIME</b>, <b>MS_MANDLOCK</b>, <b>MS_NOATIME</b>, <b>MS_NODEV</b>,
    <b>MS_NODIRATIME</b>, <b>MS_NOEXEC</b>, <b>MS_NOSUID</b>,
    <b>MS_RELATIME</b>, <b>MS_RDONLY</b>, <b>MS_STRICTATIME</b> (whose effect is
    to clear the <b>MS_NOATIME</b> and <b>MS_RELATIME</b> flags), and
    <b>MS_SYNCHRONOUS</b>. Attempts to change the setting of the
    <b>MS_DIRSYNC</b> and <b>MS_SILENT</b> flags during a remount are silently
    ignored. Note that changes to per-superblock flags are visible via all mount
    points of the associated filesystem (because the per-superblock flags are
    shared by all mount points).</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 3.17, if none of <b>MS_NOATIME</b>,
    <b>MS_NODIRATIME</b>, <b>MS_RELATIME</b>, or <b>MS_STRICTATIME</b> is
    specified in <i>mountflags</i>, then the remount operation preserves the
    existing values of these flags (rather than defaulting to
    <b>MS_RELATIME</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 2.6.26, the <b>MS_REMOUNT</b> flag can be used with
    <b>MS_BIND</b> to modify only the per-mount-point flags. This is
    particularly useful for setting or clearing the &quot;read-only&quot; flag
    on a mount point without changing the underlying filesystem. Specifying
    <i>mountflags</i> as:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
MS_REMOUNT | MS_BIND | MS_RDONLY

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">will make access through this mountpoint read-only, without
    affecting other mount points.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Creating_a_bind_mount"><a class="permalink" href="#Creating_a_bind_mount">Creating
  a bind mount</a></h2>
If <i>mountflags</i> includes <b>MS_BIND</b> (available since Linux 2.4), then
  perform a bind mount. A bind mount makes a file or a directory subtree visible
  at another point within the single directory hierarchy. Bind mounts may cross
  filesystem boundaries and span <b>chroot</b>(2) jails.
<p class="Pp">The <i>filesystemtype</i> and <i>data</i> arguments are
  ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">The remaining bits (other than <b>MS_REC</b>, described below) in
    the <i>mountflags</i> argument are also ignored. (The bind mount has the
    same mount options as the underlying mount point.) However, see the
    discussion of remounting above, for a method of making an existing bind
    mount read-only.</p>
<p class="Pp">By default, when a directory is bind mounted, only that directory
    is mounted; if there are any submounts under the directory tree, they are
    not bind mounted. If the <b>MS_REC</b> flag is also specified, then a
    recursive bind mount operation is performed: all submounts under the
    <i>source</i> subtree (other than unbindable mounts) are also bind mounted
    at the corresponding location in the <i>target</i> subtree.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Changing_the_propagation_type_of_an_existing_mount"><a class="permalink" href="#Changing_the_propagation_type_of_an_existing_mount">Changing
  the propagation type of an existing mount</a></h2>
If <i>mountflags</i> includes one of <b>MS_SHARED</b>, <b>MS_PRIVATE</b>,
  <b>MS_SLAVE</b>, or <b>MS_UNBINDABLE</b> (all available since Linux 2.6.15),
  then the propagation type of an existing mount is changed. If more than one of
  these flags is specified, an error results.
<p class="Pp">The only other flags that can be specified while changing the
    propagation type are <b>MS_REC</b> (described below) and <b>MS_SILENT</b>
    (which is ignored).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>source</i>, <i>filesystemtype</i>, and <i>data</i>
    arguments are ignored.</p>
<p class="Pp">The meanings of the propagation type flags are as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>MS_SHARED</b></dt>
  <dd>Make this mount point shared. Mount and unmount events immediately under
      this mount point will propagate to the other mount points that are members
      of this mount's peer group. Propagation here means that the same mount or
      unmount will automatically occur under all of the other mount points in
      the peer group. Conversely, mount and unmount events that take place under
      peer mount points will propagate to this mount point.</dd>
  <dt><b>MS_PRIVATE</b></dt>
  <dd>Make this mount point private. Mount and unmount events do not propagate
      into or out of this mount point.</dd>
  <dt><b>MS_SLAVE</b></dt>
  <dd>If this is a shared mount point that is a member of a peer group that
      contains other members, convert it to a slave mount. If this is a shared
      mount point that is a member of a peer group that contains no other
      members, convert it to a private mount. Otherwise, the propagation type of
      the mount point is left unchanged.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>When a mount point is a slave, mount and unmount events propagate into
      this mount point from the (master) shared peer group of which it was
      formerly a member. Mount and unmount events under this mount point do not
      propagate to any peer.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>A mount point can be the slave of another peer group while at the same
      time sharing mount and unmount events with a peer group of which it is a
      member.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>MS_UNBINDABLE</b></dt>
  <dd>Make this mount unbindable. This is like a private mount, and in addition
      this mount can't be bind mounted. When a recursive bind mount
      (<b>mount</b>() with the <b>MS_BIND</b> and <b>MS_REC</b> flags) is
      performed on a directory subtree, any unbindable mounts within the subtree
      are automatically pruned (i.e., not replicated) when replicating that
      subtree to produce the target subtree.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">By default, changing the propagation type affects only the
    <i>target</i> mount point. If the <b>MS_REC</b> flag is also specified in
    <i>mountflags</i>, then the propagation type of all mount points under
    <i>target</i> is also changed.</p>

    the default propagation type assigned to new mounts), see

If <i>mountflags</i> contains the flag <b>MS_MOVE</b> (available since Linux
  2.4.18), then move a subtree: <i>source</i> specifies an existing mount point
  and <i>target</i> specifies the new location to which that mount point is to
  be relocated. The move is atomic: at no point is the subtree unmounted.
<p class="Pp">The remaining bits in the <i>mountflags</i> argument are ignored,

Since Linux 2.4 a single filesystem can be mounted at multiple mount points, and
  multiple mounts can be stacked on the same mount point.
<p class="Pp">The <i>mountflags</i> argument may have the magic number 0xC0ED
    (<b>MS_MGC_VAL</b>) in the top 16 bits. (All of the other flags discussed in
    DESCRIPTION occupy the low order 16 bits of <i>mountflags</i>.) Specifying
    <b>MS_MGC_VAL</b> was required in kernel versions prior to 2.4, but since
    Linux 2.4 is no longer required and is ignored if specified.</p>
<p class="Pp">The original <b>MS_SYNC</b> flag was renamed <b>MS_SYNCHRONOUS</b>
    in 1.1.69 when a different <b>MS_SYNC</b> was added to
    <i>&lt;mman.h&gt;</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Before Linux 2.4 an attempt to execute a set-user-ID or
    set-group-ID program on a filesystem mounted with <b>MS_NOSUID</b> would
    fail with <b>EPERM</b>. Since Linux 2.4 the set-user-ID and set-group-ID
    bits are just silently ignored in this case.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Mount_namespaces"><a class="permalink" href="#Mount_namespaces">Mount
  namespaces</a></h2>
Starting with kernel 2.4.19, Linux provides mount namespaces. A mount namespace
  is the set of filesystem mounts that are visible to a process. Mount
  namespaces can be (and usually are) shared between multiple processes, and
  changes to the namespace (i.e., mounts and unmounts) by one process are
  visible to all other processes sharing the same namespace. (The pre-2.4.19
  Linux situation can be considered as one in which a single namespace was
  shared by every process on the system.)
<p class="Pp">A child process created by <b>fork</b>(2) shares its parent's
    mount namespace; the mount namespace is preserved across an
    <b>execve</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp">A process can obtain a private mount namespace if: it was created
    using the <b>clone</b>(2) <b>CLONE_NEWNS</b> flag, in which case its new
    namespace is initialized to be a <i>copy</i> of the namespace of the process
    that called <b>clone</b>(2); or it calls <b>unshare</b>(2) with the
    <b>CLONE_NEWNS</b> flag, which causes the caller's mount namespace to obtain
    a private copy of the namespace that it was previously sharing with other
    processes, so that future mounts and unmounts by the caller are invisible to
    other processes (except child processes that the caller subsequently
    creates) and vice versa.</p>
<p class="Pp">For further details on mount namespaces, see
    <b>mount_namespaces</b>(7).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Parental_relationship_between_mount_points"><a class="permalink" href="#Parental_relationship_between_mount_points">Parental
  relationship between mount points</a></h2>
Each mount point has a parent mount point. The overall parental relationship of
  all mount points defines the single directory hierarchy seen by the processes
  within a mount namespace.
<p class="Pp">The parent of a new mount point is defined when the mount point is
    created. In the usual case, the parent of a new mount is the mount point of
    the filesystem containing the directory or file at which the new mount is
    attached. In the case where a new mount is stacked on top of an existing
    mount, the parent of the new mount is the previous mount that was stacked at
    that location.</p>
<p class="Pp">The parental relationship between mount points can be discovered
    via the <i>/proc/[pid]/mountinfo</i> file (see below).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="/proc/_pid_/mounts_and_/proc/_pid_/mountinfo"><a class="permalink" href="#/proc/_pid_/mounts_and_/proc/_pid_/mountinfo">/proc/[pid]/mounts
  and /proc/[pid]/mountinfo</a></h2>
The Linux-specific <i>/proc/[pid]/mounts</i> file exposes the list of mount
  points in the mount namespace of the process with the specified ID. The
  <i>/proc/[pid]/mountinfo</i> file exposes even more information about mount
  points, including the propagation type and mount ID information that makes it
  possible to discover the parental relationship between mount points. See
  <b>proc</b>(5) and <b>mount_namespaces</b>(7) for details of this file.
