Apply or remove an advisory lock on the open file specified by <i>fd</i>. The
  argument <i>operation</i> is one of the following:
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>LOCK_SH</b></dt>
  <dd>Place a shared lock. More than one process may hold a shared lock for a
      given file at a given time.</dd>
  <dt><b>LOCK_EX</b></dt>
  <dd>Place an exclusive lock. Only one process may hold an exclusive lock for a
      given file at a given time.</dd>
  <dt><b>LOCK_UN</b></dt>
  <dd>Remove an existing lock held by this process.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">A call to <b>flock</b>() may block if an incompatible lock is held
    by another process. To make a nonblocking request, include <b>LOCK_NB</b>
    (by ORing) with any of the above operations.</p>
<p class="Pp">A single file may not simultaneously have both shared and
    exclusive locks.</p>
<p class="Pp">Locks created by <b>flock</b>() are associated with an open file
    description (see <b>open</b>(2)). This means that duplicate file descriptors
    (created by, for example, <b>fork</b>(2) or <b>dup</b>(2)) refer to the same
    lock, and this lock may be modified or released using any of these file
    descriptors. Furthermore, the lock is released either by an explicit
    <b>LOCK_UN</b> operation on any of these duplicate file descriptors, or when
    all such file descriptors have been closed.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a process uses <b>open</b>(2) (or similar) to obtain more than
    one file descriptor for the same file, these file descriptors are treated
    independently by <b>flock</b>(). An attempt to lock the file using one of
    these file descriptors may be denied by a lock that the calling process has
    already placed via another file descriptor.</p>
<p class="Pp">A process may hold only one type of lock (shared or exclusive) on
    a file. Subsequent <b>flock</b>() calls on an already locked file will
    convert an existing lock to the new lock mode.</p>
<p class="Pp">Locks created by <b>flock</b>() are preserved across an
    <b>execve</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp">A shared or exclusive lock can be placed on a file regardless of
    the mode in which the file was opened.</p>

4.4BSD (the <b>flock</b>() call first appeared in 4.2BSD). A version of
  <b>flock</b>(), possibly implemented in terms of <b>fcntl</b>(2), appears on
  most UNIX systems.

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
Since kernel 2.0, <b>flock</b>() is implemented as a system call in its own
  right rather than being emulated in the GNU C library as a call to
  <b>fcntl</b>(2). With this implementation, there is no interaction between the
  types of lock placed by <b>flock</b>() and <b>fcntl</b>(2), and <b>flock</b>()
  does not detect deadlock. (Note, however, that on some systems, such as the
  modern BSDs, <b>flock</b>() and <b>fcntl</b>(2) locks <i>do</i> interact with
  one another.)
<p class="Pp"><b>flock</b>() places advisory locks only; given suitable
    permissions on a file, a process is free to ignore the use of <b>flock</b>()
    and perform I/O on the file.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>flock</b>() and <b>fcntl</b>(2) locks have different semantics
    with respect to forked processes and <b>dup</b>(2). On systems that
    implement <b>flock</b>() using <b>fcntl</b>(2), the semantics of
    <b>flock</b>() will be different from those described in this manual
  page.</p>
<p class="Pp">Converting a lock (shared to exclusive, or vice versa) is not
    guaranteed to be atomic: the existing lock is first removed, and then a new
    lock is established. Between these two steps, a pending lock request by
    another process may be granted, with the result that the conversion either
    blocks, or fails if <b>LOCK_NB</b> was specified. (This is the original BSD
    behavior, and occurs on many other implementations.)</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="NFS_details"><a class="permalink" href="#NFS_details">NFS
  details</a></h2>
In Linux kernels up to 2.6.11, <b>flock</b>() does not lock files over NFS
  (i.e., the scope of locks was limited to the local system). Instead, one could
  use <b>fcntl</b>(2) byte-range locking, which does work over NFS, given a
  sufficiently recent version of Linux and a server which supports locking.
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 2.6.12, NFS clients support <b>flock</b>() locks by
    emulating them as <b>fcntl</b>(2) byte-range locks on the entire file. This
    means that <b>fcntl</b>(2) and <b>flock</b>() locks <i>do</i> interact with
    one another over NFS. It also means that in order to place an exclusive
    lock, the file must be opened for writing.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 2.6.37, the kernel supports a compatibility mode that
    allows <b>flock</b>() locks (and also <b>fcntl</b>(2) byte region locks) to
    be treated as local; see the discussion of the <i>local_lock</i> option in
    <b>nfs</b>(5).</p>
