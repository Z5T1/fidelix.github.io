<b>mmap</b>() creates a new mapping in the virtual address space of the calling
  process. The starting address for the new mapping is specified in <i>addr</i>.
  The <i>length</i> argument specifies the length of the mapping (which must be
  greater than 0).
<p class="Pp">If <i>addr</i> is NULL, then the kernel chooses the (page-aligned)
    address at which to create the mapping; this is the most portable method of
    creating a new mapping. If <i>addr</i> is not NULL, then the kernel takes it
    as a hint about where to place the mapping; on Linux, the kernel will pick a
    nearby page boundary (but always above or equal to the value specified by
    <i>/proc/sys/vm/mmap_min_addr</i>) and attempt to create the mapping there.
    If another mapping already exists there, the kernel picks a new address that
    may or may not depend on the hint. The address of the new mapping is
    returned as the result of the call.</p>
<p class="Pp">The contents of a file mapping (as opposed to an anonymous
    mapping; see <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b> below), are initialized using
    <i>length</i> bytes starting at offset <i>offset</i> in the file (or other
    object) referred to by the file descriptor <i>fd</i>. <i>offset</i> must be
    a multiple of the page size as returned by
  <i>sysconf(_SC_PAGE_SIZE)</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">After the <b>mmap</b>() call has returned, the file descriptor,
    <i>fd</i>, can be closed immediately without invalidating the mapping.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>prot</i> argument describes the desired memory protection
    of the mapping (and must not conflict with the open mode of the file). It is
    either <b>PROT_NONE</b> or the bitwise OR of one or more of the following
    flags:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>PROT_EXEC</b></dt>
  <dd>Pages may be executed.</dd>
  <dt><b>PROT_READ</b></dt>
  <dd>Pages may be read.</dd>
  <dt><b>PROT_WRITE</b></dt>
  <dd>Pages may be written.</dd>
  <dt><b>PROT_NONE</b></dt>
  <dd>Pages may not be accessed.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The <i>flags</i> argument determines whether updates to the
    mapping are visible to other processes mapping the same region, and whether
    updates are carried through to the underlying file. This behavior is
    determined by including exactly one of the following values in
  <i>flags</i>:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>MAP_SHARED</b></dt>
  <dd>Share this mapping. Updates to the mapping are visible to other processes
      mapping the same region, and (in the case of file-backed mappings) are
      carried through to the underlying file. (To precisely control when updates
      are carried through to the underlying file requires the use of
      <b>msync</b>(2).)</dd>
  <dt><b>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE</b> (since Linux 4.15)</dt>
  <dd>This flag provides the same behavior as <b>MAP_SHARED</b> except that
      <b>MAP_SHARED</b> mappings ignore unknown flags in <i>flags</i>. By
      contrast, when creating a mapping using <b>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE</b>, the
      kernel verifies all passed flags are known and fails the mapping with the
      error <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b> for unknown flags. This mapping type is also
      required to be able to use some mapping flags (e.g.,
    <b>MAP_SYNC</b>).</dd>
  <dt><b>MAP_PRIVATE</b></dt>
  <dd>Create a private copy-on-write mapping. Updates to the mapping are not
      visible to other processes mapping the same file, and are not carried
      through to the underlying file. It is unspecified whether changes made to
      the file after the <b>mmap</b>() call are visible in the mapped
    region.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Both <b>MAP_SHARED</b> and <b>MAP_PRIVATE</b> are described in
    POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008. <b>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE</b> is a Linux
    extension.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition, zero or more of the following values can be ORed in
    <i>flags</i>:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>MAP_32BIT</b> (since Linux 2.4.20, 2.6)</dt>
  <dd>Put the mapping into the first 2 Gigabytes of the process address space.
      This flag is supported only on x86-64, for 64-bit programs. It was added
      to allow thread stacks to be allocated somewhere in the first 2&#x00A0;GB
      of memory, so as to improve context-switch performance on some early
      64-bit processors. Modern x86-64 processors no longer have this
      performance problem, so use of this flag is not required on those systems.
      The <b>MAP_32BIT</b> flag is ignored when <b>MAP_FIXED</b> is set.</dd>
  <dt><b>MAP_ANON</b></dt>
  <dd>Synonym for <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b>. Deprecated.</dd>
  <dt><b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b></dt>
  <dd>The mapping is not backed by any file; its contents are initialized to
      zero. The <i>fd</i> argument is ignored; however, some implementations
      require <i>fd</i> to be -1 if <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b> (or <b>MAP_ANON</b>) is
      specified, and portable applications should ensure this. The <i>offset</i>
      argument should be zero. The use of <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b> in conjunction
      with <b>MAP_SHARED</b> is supported on Linux only since kernel 2.4.</dd>
  <dt><b>MAP_DENYWRITE</b></dt>
  <dd>This flag is ignored. (Long ago&#x2014;Linux 2.0 and earlier&#x2014;it
      signaled that attempts to write to the underlying file should fail with
      <b>ETXTBUSY</b>. But this was a source of denial-of-service attacks.)</dd>
  <dt><b>MAP_EXECUTABLE</b></dt>
  <dd>This flag is ignored.</dd>
  <dt><b>MAP_FILE</b></dt>
  <dd>Compatibility flag. Ignored.</dd>
  <dt><b>MAP_FIXED</b></dt>
  <dd>Don't interpret <i>addr</i> as a hint: place the mapping at exactly that
      address. <i>addr</i> must be suitably aligned: for most architectures a
      multiple of the page size is sufficient; however, some architectures may
      impose additional restrictions. If the memory region specified by
      <i>addr</i> and <i>len</i> overlaps pages of any existing mapping(s), then
      the overlapped part of the existing mapping(s) will be discarded. If the
      specified address cannot be used, <b>mmap</b>() will fail.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Software that aspires to be portable should use the <b>MAP_FIXED</b> flag
      with care, keeping in mind that the exact layout of a process's memory
      mappings is allowed to change significantly between kernel versions, C
      library versions, and operating system releases. <i>Carefully read the
      discussion of this flag in NOTES!</i></dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE</b> (since Linux 4.17)</dt>
  <dd>This flag provides behavior that is similar to <b>MAP_FIXED</b> with
      respect to the <i>addr</i> enforcement, but differs in that
      <b>MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE</b> never clobbers a preexisting mapped range. If
      the requested range would collide with an existing mapping, then this call
      fails with the error <b>EEXIST.</b> This flag can therefore be used as a
      way to atomically (with respect to other threads) attempt to map an
      address range: one thread will succeed; all others will report
    failure.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Note that older kernels which do not recognize the
      <b>MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE</b> flag will typically (upon detecting a collision
      with a preexisting mapping) fall back to a
      &quot;non-<b>MAP_FIXED</b>&quot; type of behavior: they will return an
      address that is different from the requested address. Therefore,
      backward-compatible software should check the returned address against the
      requested address.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>MAP_GROWSDOWN</b></dt>
  <dd>This flag is used for stacks. It indicates to the kernel virtual memory
      system that the mapping should extend downward in memory. The return
      address is one page lower than the memory area that is actually created in
      the process's virtual address space. Touching an address in the
      &quot;guard&quot; page below the mapping will cause the mapping to grow by
      a page. This growth can be repeated until the mapping grows to within a
      page of the high end of the next lower mapping, at which point touching
      the &quot;guard&quot; page will result in a <b>SIGSEGV</b> signal.</dd>
  <dt><b>MAP_HUGETLB</b> (since Linux 2.6.32)</dt>
  <dd>Allocate the mapping using &quot;huge pages.&quot; See the Linux kernel
      source file <i>Documentation/admin-guide/mm/hugetlbpage.rst</i> for
      further information, as well as NOTES, below.</dd>
  <dt><b>MAP_HUGE_2MB</b>, <b>MAP_HUGE_1GB</b> (since Linux 3.8)</dt>
  <dd>Used in conjunction with <b>MAP_HUGETLB</b> to select alternative hugetlb
      page sizes (respectively, 2&#x00A0;MB and 1&#x00A0;GB) on systems that
      support multiple hugetlb page sizes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>More generally, the desired huge page size can be configured by encoding
      the base-2 logarithm of the desired page size in the six bits at the
      offset <b>MAP_HUGE_SHIFT</b>. (A value of zero in this bit field provides
      the default huge page size; the default huge page size can be discovered
      via the <i>Hugepagesize</i> field exposed by <i>/proc/meminfo</i>.) Thus,
      the above two constants are defined as:</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    <pre>
#define MAP_HUGE_2MB    (21 &lt;&lt; MAP_HUGE_SHIFT)
#define MAP_HUGE_1GB    (30 &lt;&lt; MAP_HUGE_SHIFT)

    </pre>
    <br/>
  </dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The range of huge page sizes that are supported by the system can be
      discovered by listing the subdirectories in
      <i>/sys/kernel/mm/hugepages</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>MAP_LOCKED</b> (since Linux 2.5.37)</dt>
  <dd>Mark the mapped region to be locked in the same way as <b>mlock</b>(2).
      This implementation will try to populate (prefault) the whole range but
      the <b>mmap</b>() call doesn't fail with <b>ENOMEM</b> if this fails.
      Therefore major faults might happen later on. So the semantic is not as
      strong as <b>mlock</b>(2). One should use <b>mmap</b>() plus
      <b>mlock</b>(2) when major faults are not acceptable after the
      initialization of the mapping. The <b>MAP_LOCKED</b> flag is ignored in
      older kernels.</dd>
  <dt><b>MAP_NONBLOCK</b> (since Linux 2.5.46)</dt>
  <dd>This flag is meaningful only in conjunction with <b>MAP_POPULATE</b>.
      Don't perform read-ahead: create page tables entries only for pages that
      are already present in RAM. Since Linux 2.6.23, this flag causes
      <b>MAP_POPULATE</b> to do nothing. One day, the combination of
      <b>MAP_POPULATE</b> and <b>MAP_NONBLOCK</b> may be reimplemented.</dd>
  <dt><b>MAP_NORESERVE</b></dt>
  <dd>Do not reserve swap space for this mapping. When swap space is reserved,
      one has the guarantee that it is possible to modify the mapping. When swap
      space is not reserved one might get <b>SIGSEGV</b> upon a write if no
      physical memory is available. See also the discussion of the file
      <i>/proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory</i> in <b>proc</b>(5). In kernels before
      2.6, this flag had effect only for private writable mappings.</dd>
  <dt><b>MAP_POPULATE</b> (since Linux 2.5.46)</dt>
  <dd>Populate (prefault) page tables for a mapping. For a file mapping, this
      causes read-ahead on the file. This will help to reduce blocking on page
      faults later. <b>MAP_POPULATE</b> is supported for private mappings only
      since Linux 2.6.23.</dd>
  <dt><b>MAP_STACK</b> (since Linux 2.6.27)</dt>
  <dd>Allocate the mapping at an address suitable for a process or thread
    stack.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>This flag is currently a no-op on Linux. However, by employing this flag,
      applications can ensure that they transparently obtain support if the flag
      is implemented in the future. Thus, it is used in the glibc threading
      implementation to allow for the fact that some architectures may (later)
      require special treatment for stack allocations. A further reason to
      employ this flag is portability: <b>MAP_STACK</b> exists (and has an
      effect) on some other systems (e.g., some of the BSDs).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>MAP_SYNC</b> (since Linux 4.15)</dt>
  <dd>This flag is available only with the <b>MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE</b> mapping
      type; mappings of type <b>MAP_SHARED</b> will silently ignore this flag.
      This flag is supported only for files supporting DAX (direct mapping of
      persistent memory). For other files, creating a mapping with this flag
      results in an <b>EOPNOTSUPP</b> error.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Shared file mappings with this flag provide the guarantee that while some
      memory is writably mapped in the address space of the process, it will be
      visible in the same file at the same offset even after the system crashes
      or is rebooted. In conjunction with the use of appropriate CPU
      instructions, this provides users of such mappings with a more efficient
      way of making data modifications persistent.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>MAP_UNINITIALIZED</b> (since Linux 2.6.33)</dt>
  <dd>Don't clear anonymous pages. This flag is intended to improve performance
      on embedded devices. This flag is honored only if the kernel was
      configured with the <b>CONFIG_MMAP_ALLOW_UNINITIALIZED</b> option. Because
      of the security implications, that option is normally enabled only on
      embedded devices (i.e., devices where one has complete control of the
      contents of user memory).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Of the above flags, only <b>MAP_FIXED</b> is specified in
    POSIX.1-2001 and POSIX.1-2008. However, most systems also support
    <b>MAP_ANONYMOUS</b> (or its synonym <b>MAP_ANON</b>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Memory mapped by <b>mmap</b>() is preserved across <b>fork</b>(2),
    with the same attributes.</p>
<p class="Pp">A file is mapped in multiples of the page size. For a file that is
    not a multiple of the page size, the remaining memory is zeroed when mapped,
    and writes to that region are not written out to the file. The effect of
    changing the size of the underlying file of a mapping on the pages that
    correspond to added or removed regions of the file is unspecified.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="munmap()"><a class="permalink" href="#munmap()">munmap()</a></h2>
The <b>munmap</b>() system call deletes the mappings for the specified address
  range, and causes further references to addresses within the range to generate
  invalid memory references. The region is also automatically unmapped when the
  process is terminated. On the other hand, closing the file descriptor does not
  unmap the region.
<p class="Pp">The address <i>addr</i> must be a multiple of the page size (but
    <i>length</i> need not be). All pages containing a part of the indicated

On some hardware architectures (e.g., i386), <b>PROT_WRITE</b> implies
  <b>PROT_READ</b>. It is architecture dependent whether <b>PROT_READ</b>
  implies <b>PROT_EXEC</b> or not. Portable programs should always set
  <b>PROT_EXEC</b> if they intend to execute code in the new mapping.
<p class="Pp">The portable way to create a mapping is to specify <i>addr</i> as
    0 (NULL), and omit <b>MAP_FIXED</b> from <i>flags</i>. In this case, the
    system chooses the address for the mapping; the address is chosen so as not
    to conflict with any existing mapping, and will not be 0. If the
    <b>MAP_FIXED</b> flag is specified, and <i>addr</i> is 0 (NULL), then the
    mapped address will be 0 (NULL).</p>
<p class="Pp">Certain <i>flags</i> constants are defined only if suitable

  otherwise, the use of <b>MAP_FIXED</b> is hazardous because it forcibly
  removes preexisting mappings, making it easy for a multithreaded process to
  corrupt its own address space.
<p class="Pp">For example, suppose that thread A looks through
    <i>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/maps</i> and in order to locate an unused address range
    that it can map using <b>MAP_FIXED</b>, while thread B simultaneously
    acquires part or all of that same address range. When thread A subsequently
    employs <b>mmap(MAP_FIXED)</b>, it will effectively clobber the mapping that
    thread B created. In this scenario, thread B need not create a mapping
    directly; simply making a library call that, internally, uses
    <b>dlopen</b>(3) to load some other shared library, will suffice. The
    <b>dlopen</b>(3) call will map the library into the process's address space.
    Furthermore, almost any library call may be implemented in a way that adds
    memory mappings to the address space, either with this technique, or by
    simply allocating memory. Examples include <b>brk</b>(2), <b>malloc</b>(3),
    <b>pthread_create</b>(3), and the PAM libraries
    <a class="Lk" href="http://www.linux-pam.org">http://www.linux-pam.org</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 4.17, a multithreaded program can use the
    <b>MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE</b> flag to avoid the hazard described above when
    attempting to create a mapping at a fixed address that has not been reserved
    by a preexisting mapping.</p>

For file-backed mappings, the <i>st_atime</i> field for the mapped file may be
  updated at any time between the <b>mmap</b>() and the corresponding unmapping;
  the first reference to a mapped page will update the field if it has not been
  already.
<p class="Pp">The <i>st_ctime</i> and <i>st_mtime</i> field for a file mapped
    with <b>PROT_WRITE</b> and <b>MAP_SHARED</b> will be updated after a write
    to the mapped region, and before a subsequent <b>msync</b>(2) with the
    <b>MS_SYNC</b> or <b>MS_ASYNC</b> flag, if one occurs.</p>

For mappings that employ huge pages, the requirements for the arguments of
  <b>mmap</b>() and <b>munmap</b>() differ somewhat from the requirements for
  mappings that use the native system page size.
<p class="Pp">For <b>mmap</b>(), <i>offset</i> must be a multiple of the
    underlying huge page size. The system automatically aligns <i>length</i> to
    be a multiple of the underlying huge page size.</p>
<p class="Pp">For <b>munmap</b>(), <i>addr</i> and <i>length</i> must both be a
    multiple of the underlying huge page size.</p>

This page describes the interface provided by the glibc <b>mmap</b>() wrapper
  function. Originally, this function invoked a system call of the same name.
  Since kernel 2.4, that system call has been superseded by <b>mmap2</b>(2), and
  nowadays the glibc <b>mmap</b>() wrapper function invokes <b>mmap2</b>(2) with
  a suitably adjusted value for <i>offset</i>.

On Linux, there are no guarantees like those suggested above under
  <b>MAP_NORESERVE</b>. By default, any process can be killed at any moment when
  the system runs out of memory.
<p class="Pp">In kernels before 2.6.7, the <b>MAP_POPULATE</b> flag has effect
    only if <i>prot</i> is specified as <b>PROT_NONE</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">SUSv3 specifies that <b>mmap</b>() should fail if <i>length</i> is
    0. However, in kernels before 2.6.12, <b>mmap</b>() succeeded in this case:
    no mapping was created and the call returned <i>addr</i>. Since kernel
    2.6.12, <b>mmap</b>() fails with the error <b>EINVAL</b> for this case.</p>
<p class="Pp">POSIX specifies that the system shall always zero fill any partial
    page at the end of the object and that system will never write any
    modification of the object beyond its end. On Linux, when you write data to
    such partial page after the end of the object, the data stays in the page
    cache even after the file is closed and unmapped and even though the data is
    never written to the file itself, subsequent mappings may see the modified
    content. In some cases, this could be fixed by calling <b>msync</b>(2)
    before the unmap takes place; however, this doesn't work on <b>tmpfs</b>(5)
    (for example, when using the POSIX shared memory interface documented in
    <b>shm_overview</b>(7)).</p>

The following program prints part of the file specified in its first
  command-line argument to standard output. The range of bytes to be printed is
  specified via offset and length values in the second and third command-line
  arguments. The program creates a memory mapping of the required pages of the
  file and then uses <b>write</b>(2) to output the desired bytes.
