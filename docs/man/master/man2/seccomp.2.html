The <b>seccomp</b>() system call operates on the Secure Computing (seccomp)
  state of the calling process.
<p class="Pp">Currently, Linux supports the following <i>operation</i>
  values:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>SECCOMP_SET_MODE_STRICT</b></dt>
  <dd>The only system calls that the calling thread is permitted to make are
      <b>read</b>(2), <b>write</b>(2), <b>_exit</b>(2) (but not
      <b>exit_group</b>(2)), and <b>sigreturn</b>(2). Other system calls result
      in the delivery of a <b>SIGKILL</b> signal. Strict secure computing mode
      is useful for number-crunching applications that may need to execute
      untrusted byte code, perhaps obtained by reading from a pipe or
    socket.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Note that although the calling thread can no longer call
      <b>sigprocmask</b>(2), it can use <b>sigreturn</b>(2) to block all signals
      apart from <b>SIGKILL</b> and <b>SIGSTOP</b>. This means that
      <b>alarm</b>(2) (for example) is not sufficient for restricting the
      process's execution time. Instead, to reliably terminate the process,
      <b>SIGKILL</b> must be used. This can be done by using
      <b>timer_create</b>(2) with <b>SIGEV_SIGNAL</b> and <i>sigev_signo</i> set
      to <b>SIGKILL</b>, or by using <b>setrlimit</b>(2) to set the hard limit
      for <b>RLIMIT_CPU</b>.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>This operation is available only if the kernel is configured with
      <b>CONFIG_SECCOMP</b> enabled.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The value of <i>flags</i> must be 0, and <i>args</i> must be NULL.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>This operation is functionally identical to the call:</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    <pre>
prctl(PR_SET_SECCOMP, SECCOMP_MODE_STRICT);

    </pre>
    <br/>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER</b></dt>
  <dd>The system calls allowed are defined by a pointer to a Berkeley Packet
      Filter (BPF) passed via <i>args</i>. This argument is a pointer to a
      <i>struct&#x00A0;sock_fprog</i>; it can be designed to filter arbitrary
      system calls and system call arguments. If the filter is invalid,
      <b>seccomp</b>() fails, returning <b>EINVAL</b> in <i>errno</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>If <b>fork</b>(2) or <b>clone</b>(2) is allowed by the filter, any child
      processes will be constrained to the same system call filters as the
      parent. If <b>execve</b>(2) is allowed, the existing filters will be
      preserved across a call to <b>execve</b>(2).</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>In order to use the <b>SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER</b> operation, either the
      calling thread must have the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> capability in its user
      namespace, or the thread must already have the <i>no_new_privs</i> bit
      set. If that bit was not already set by an ancestor of this thread, the
      thread must make the following call:</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    <pre>
prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, 1);

    </pre>
    <br/>
  </dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Otherwise, the <b>SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER</b> operation fails and returns
      <b>EACCES</b> in <i>errno</i>. This requirement ensures that an
      unprivileged process cannot apply a malicious filter and then invoke a
      set-user-ID or other privileged program using <b>execve</b>(2), thus
      potentially compromising that program. (Such a malicious filter might, for
      example, cause an attempt to use <b>setuid</b>(2) to set the caller's user
      IDs to nonzero values to instead return 0 without actually making the
      system call. Thus, the program might be tricked into retaining superuser
      privileges in circumstances where it is possible to influence it to do
      dangerous things because it did not actually drop privileges.)</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>If <b>prctl</b>(2) or <b>seccomp</b>() is allowed by the attached filter,
      further filters may be added. This will increase evaluation time, but
      allows for further reduction of the attack surface during execution of a
      thread.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The <b>SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER</b> operation is available only if the
      kernel is configured with <b>CONFIG_SECCOMP_FILTER</b> enabled.</dd>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Filters"><a class="permalink" href="#Filters">Filters</a></h2>
When adding filters via <b>SECCOMP_SET_MODE_FILTER</b>, <i>args</i> points to a
  filter program:
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
struct sock_fprog {
    unsigned short      len;    /* Number of BPF instructions */
    struct sock_filter *filter; /* Pointer to array of
                                   BPF instructions */
};

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">Each program must contain one or more BPF instructions:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
struct sock_filter {            /* Filter block */
    __u16 code;                 /* Actual filter code */
    __u8  jt;                   /* Jump true */
    __u8  jf;                   /* Jump false */
    __u32 k;                    /* Generic multiuse field */
};

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">When executing the instructions, the BPF program operates on the
    system call information made available (i.e., use the <b>BPF_ABS</b>
    addressing mode) as a (read-only) buffer of the following form:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
struct seccomp_data {
    int   nr;                   /* System call number */
    __u32 arch;                 /* AUDIT_ARCH_* value
                                   (see &lt;linux/audit.h&gt;) */
    __u64 instruction_pointer;  /* CPU instruction pointer */
    __u64 args[6];              /* Up to 6 system call arguments */
};

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">Because numbering of system calls varies between architectures and
    some architectures (e.g., x86-64) allow user-space code to use the calling
    conventions of multiple architectures (and the convention being used may
    vary over the life of a process that uses <b>execve</b>(2) to execute
    binaries that employ the different conventions), it is usually necessary to
    verify the value of the <i>arch</i> field.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is strongly recommended to use an allow-list approach whenever
    possible because such an approach is more robust and simple. A deny-list
    will have to be updated whenever a potentially dangerous system call is
    added (or a dangerous flag or option if those are deny-listed), and it is
    often possible to alter the representation of a value without altering its
    meaning, leading to a deny-list bypass. See also <i>Caveats</i> below.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>arch</i> field is not unique for all calling conventions.
    The x86-64 ABI and the x32 ABI both use <b>AUDIT_ARCH_X86_64</b> as
    <i>arch</i>, and they run on the same processors. Instead, the mask
    <b>__X32_SYSCALL_BIT</b> is used on the system call number to tell the two
    ABIs apart.</p>
<p class="Pp">This means that in order to create a seccomp-based deny-list for
    system calls performed through the x86-64 ABI, it is necessary to not only
    check that <i>arch</i> equals <b>AUDIT_ARCH_X86_64</b>, but also to
    explicitly reject all system calls that contain <b>__X32_SYSCALL_BIT</b> in
    <i>nr</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>instruction_pointer</i> field provides the address of the
    machine-language instruction that performed the system call. This might be
    useful in conjunction with the use of <i>/proc/[pid]/maps</i> to perform
    checks based on which region (mapping) of the program made the system call.
    (Probably, it is wise to lock down the <b>mmap</b>(2) and <b>mprotect</b>(2)
    system calls to prevent the program from subverting such checks.)</p>
<p class="Pp">When checking values from <i>args</i> against a deny-list, keep in
    mind that arguments are often silently truncated before being processed, but
    after the seccomp check. For example, this happens if the i386 ABI is used
    on an x86-64 kernel: although the kernel will normally not look beyond the
    32 lowest bits of the arguments, the values of the full 64-bit registers
    will be present in the seccomp data. A less surprising example is that if
    the x86-64 ABI is used to perform a system call that takes an argument of
    type <i>int</i>, the more-significant half of the argument register is
    ignored by the system call, but visible in the seccomp data.</p>
<p class="Pp">A seccomp filter returns a 32-bit value consisting of two parts:
    the most significant 16 bits (corresponding to the mask defined by the
    constant <b>SECCOMP_RET_ACTION_FULL</b>) contain one of the
    &quot;action&quot; values listed below; the least significant 16-bits
    (defined by the constant <b>SECCOMP_RET_DATA</b>) are &quot;data&quot; to be
    associated with this return value.</p>
<p class="Pp">If multiple filters exist, they are <i>all</i> executed, in
    reverse order of their addition to the filter tree&#x2014;that is, the most
    recently installed filter is executed first. (Note that all filters will be
    called even if one of the earlier filters returns <b>SECCOMP_RET_KILL</b>.
    This is done to simplify the kernel code and to provide a tiny speed-up in
    the execution of sets of filters by avoiding a check for this uncommon
    case.) The return value for the evaluation of a given system call is the
    first-seen action value of highest precedence (along with its accompanying
    data) returned by execution of all of the filters.</p>
<p class="Pp">In decreasing order of precedence, the action values that may be
    returned by a seccomp filter are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>SECCOMP_RET_KILL_PROCESS</b> (since Linux 4.14)</dt>
  <dd>This value results in immediate termination of the process, with a core
      dump. The system call is not executed. By contrast with
      <b>SECCOMP_RET_KILL_THREAD</b> below, all threads in the thread group are
      terminated. (For a discussion of thread groups, see the description of the
      <b>CLONE_THREAD</b> flag in <b>clone</b>(2).)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd>The process terminates <i>as though</i> killed by a <b>SIGSYS</b> signal.
      Even if a signal handler has been registered for <b>SIGSYS</b>, the
      handler will be ignored in this case and the process always terminates. To
      a parent process that is waiting on this process (using <b>waitpid</b>(2)
      or similar), the returned <i>wstatus</i> will indicate that its child was
      terminated as though by a <b>SIGSYS</b> signal.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>SECCOMP_RET_KILL_THREAD</b> (or <b>SECCOMP_RET_KILL</b>)</dt>

Since Linux 4.14, the kernel provides the facility to log the actions returned
  by seccomp filters in the audit log. The kernel makes the decision to log an
  action based on the action type, whether or not the action is present in the
  <i>actions_logged</i> file, and whether kernel auditing is enabled (e.g., via
  the kernel boot option <i>audit=1</i>). The rules are as follows:

<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
Rather than hand-coding seccomp filters as shown in the example below, you may
  prefer to employ the <i>libseccomp</i> library, which provides a front-end for
  generating seccomp filters.
<p class="Pp">The <i>Seccomp</i> field of the <i>/proc/[pid]/status</i> file
    provides a method of viewing the seccomp mode of a process; see
    <b>proc</b>(5).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>seccomp</b>() provides a superset of the functionality provided
    by the <b>prctl</b>(2) <b>PR_SET_SECCOMP</b> operation (which does not
    support <i>flags</i>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Since Linux 4.4, the <b>ptrace</b>(2)
    <b>PTRACE_SECCOMP_GET_FILTER</b> operation can be used to dump a process's
    seccomp filters.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Architecture_support_for_seccomp_BPF"><a class="permalink" href="#Architecture_support_for_seccomp_BPF">Architecture
  support for seccomp BPF</a></h2>
Architecture support for seccomp BPF filtering is available on the following
  architectures:
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>x86-64, i386, x32 (since Linux 3.5)</li>
  <li>ARM (since Linux 3.8)</li>
  <li>s390 (since Linux 3.8)</li>
  <li>MIPS (since Linux 3.16)</li>
  <li>ARM-64 (since Linux 3.19)</li>
  <li>PowerPC (since Linux 4.3)</li>

</ul>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Caveats"><a class="permalink" href="#Caveats">Caveats</a></h2>
There are various subtleties to consider when applying seccomp filters to a
  program, including the following:
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Some traditional system calls have user-space implementations in the
      <b>vdso</b>(7) on many architectures. Notable examples include
      <b>clock_gettime</b>(2), <b>gettimeofday</b>(2), and <b>time</b>(2). On
      such architectures, seccomp filtering for these system calls will have no
      effect. (However, there are cases where the <b>vdso</b>(7) implementations
      may fall back to invoking the true system call, in which case seccomp
      filters would see the system call.)</li>
  <li>Seccomp filtering is based on system call numbers. However, applications
      typically do not directly invoke system calls, but instead call wrapper
      functions in the C library which in turn invoke the system calls.
      Consequently, one must be aware of the following:</li>
</ul>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The glibc wrappers for some traditional system calls may actually employ
      system calls with different names in the kernel. For example, the
      <b>exit</b>(2) wrapper function actually employs the <b>exit_group</b>(2)
      system call, and the <b>fork</b>(2) wrapper function actually calls
      <b>clone</b>(2).</li>
  <li>The behavior of wrapper functions may vary across architectures, according
      to the range of system calls provided on those architectures. In other
      words, the same wrapper function may invoke different system calls on
      different architectures.</li>
  <li>Finally, the behavior of wrapper functions can change across glibc
      versions. For example, in older versions, the glibc wrapper function for
      <b>open</b>(2) invoked the system call of the same name, but starting in
      glibc 2.26, the implementation switched to calling <b>openat</b>(2) on all
      architectures.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The consequence of the above points is that it may be necessary to
    filter for a system call other than might be expected. Various manual pages
    in Section 2 provide helpful details about the differences between wrapper
    functions and the underlying system calls in subsections entitled <i>C
    library/kernel differences</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Furthermore, note that the application of seccomp filters even
    risks causing bugs in an application, when the filters cause unexpected
    failures for legitimate operations that the application might need to
    perform. Such bugs may not easily be discovered when testing the seccomp
    filters if the bugs occur in rarely used application code paths.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Seccomp-specific_BPF_details"><a class="permalink" href="#Seccomp-specific_BPF_details">Seccomp-specific
  BPF details</a></h2>
Note the following BPF details specific to seccomp filters:
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The <b>BPF_H</b> and <b>BPF_B</b> size modifiers are not supported: all
      operations must load and store (4-byte) words (<b>BPF_W</b>).</li>
  <li>To access the contents of the <i>seccomp_data</i> buffer, use the
      <b>BPF_ABS</b> addressing mode modifier.</li>
  <li>The <b>BPF_LEN</b> addressing mode modifier yields an immediate mode
      operand whose value is the size of the <i>seccomp_data</i> buffer.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLE"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLE">EXAMPLE</a></h1>
The program below accepts four or more arguments. The first three arguments are
  a system call number, a numeric architecture identifier, and an error number.
  The program uses these values to construct a BPF filter that is used at run
  time to perform the following checks:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>[1]</dt>
  <dd>If the program is not running on the specified architecture, the BPF
      filter causes system calls to fail with the error <b>ENOSYS</b>.</dd>
  <dt>[2]</dt>
  <dd>If the program attempts to execute the system call with the specified
      number, the BPF filter causes the system call to fail, with <i>errno</i>
      being set to the specified error number.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The remaining command-line arguments specify the pathname and
    additional arguments of a program that the example program should attempt to
    execute using <b>execv</b>(3) (a library function that employs the
    <b>execve</b>(2) system call). Some example runs of the program are shown
    below.</p>
<p class="Pp">First, we display the architecture that we are running on (x86-64)
    and then construct a shell function that looks up system call numbers on
    this architecture:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>uname -m</b>
x86_64
$ <b>syscall_nr() {</b>
<b>    cat /usr/src/linux/arch/x86/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl | \</b>
<b>    awk '$2 != &quot;x32&quot; &amp;&amp; $3 == &quot;'$1'&quot; { print $1 }'</b>
<b>}</b>

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">When the BPF filter rejects a system call (case [2] above), it
    causes the system call to fail with the error number specified on the
    command line. In the experiments shown here, we'll use error number 99:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>errno 99</b>
EADDRNOTAVAIL 99 Cannot assign requested address

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">In the following example, we attempt to run the command
    <b>whoami</b>(1), but the BPF filter rejects the <b>execve</b>(2) system
    call, so that the command is not even executed:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>syscall_nr execve</b>
59
$ <b>./a.out</b>
Usage: ./a.out &lt;syscall_nr&gt; &lt;arch&gt; &lt;errno&gt; &lt;prog&gt; [&lt;args&gt;]
Hint for &lt;arch&gt;: AUDIT_ARCH_I386: 0x40000003
                 AUDIT_ARCH_X86_64: 0xC000003E
$ <b>./a.out 59 0xC000003E 99 /bin/whoami</b>
execv: Cannot assign requested address

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">In the next example, the BPF filter rejects the <b>write</b>(2)
    system call, so that, although it is successfully started, the
    <b>whoami</b>(1) command is not able to write output:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>syscall_nr write</b>
1
$ <b>./a.out 1 0xC000003E 99 /bin/whoami</b>

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">In the final example, the BPF filter rejects a system call that is
    not used by the <b>whoami</b>(1) command, so it is able to successfully
    execute and produce output:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>syscall_nr preadv</b>

$ <b>./a.out 295 0xC000003E 99 /bin/whoami</b>
