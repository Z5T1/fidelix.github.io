ld.so, ld-linux.so - dynamic linker/loader
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="SYNOPSIS"><a class="permalink" href="#SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</a></h1>
The dynamic linker can be run either indirectly by running some dynamically
  linked program or shared object (in which case no command-line options to the
  dynamic linker can be passed and, in the ELF case, the dynamic linker which is
  stored in the <b>.interp</b> section of the program is executed) or directly
  by running:
<p class="Pp"><i>/lib/ld-linux.so.*</i> [OPTIONS] [PROGRAM [ARGUMENTS]]</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The programs <b>ld.so</b> and <b>ld-linux.so*</b> find and load the shared
  objects (shared libraries) needed by a program, prepare the program to run,
  and then run it.
<p class="Pp">Linux binaries require dynamic linking (linking at run time)
    unless the <b>-static</b> option was given to <b>ld</b>(1) during
    compilation.</p>
<p class="Pp">The program <b>ld.so</b> handles a.out binaries, a binary format
    used long ago. The program <b>ld-linux.so*</b> (<i>/lib/ld-linux.so.1</i>
    for libc5, <i>/lib/ld-linux.so.2</i> for glibc2) handles binaries that are
    in the more modern ELF format. Both programs have the same behavior, and use
    the same support files and programs (<b>ldd</b>(1), <b>ldconfig</b>(8), and
    <i>/etc/ld.so.conf</i>).</p>
<p class="Pp">When resolving shared object dependencies, the dynamic linker
    first inspects each dependency string to see if it contains a slash (this
    can occur if a shared object pathname containing slashes was specified at
    link time). If a slash is found, then the dependency string is interpreted
    as a (relative or absolute) pathname, and the shared object is loaded using
    that pathname.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a shared object dependency does not contain a slash, then it is
    searched for in the following order:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>o</dt>
  <dd>Using the directories specified in the DT_RPATH dynamic section attribute
      of the binary if present and DT_RUNPATH attribute does not exist. Use of
      DT_RPATH is deprecated.</dd>
  <dt>o</dt>
  <dd>Using the environment variable <b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b>, unless the
      executable is being run in secure-execution mode (see below), in which
      case this variable is ignored.</dd>
  <dt>o</dt>
  <dd>Using the directories specified in the DT_RUNPATH dynamic section
      attribute of the binary if present. Such directories are searched only to
      find those objects required by DT_NEEDED (direct dependencies) entries and
      do not apply to those objects' children, which must themselves have their
      own DT_RUNPATH entries. This is unlike DT_RPATH, which is applied to
      searches for all children in the dependency tree.</dd>
  <dt>o</dt>
  <dd>From the cache file <i>/etc/ld.so.cache</i>, which contains a compiled
      list of candidate shared objects previously found in the augmented library
      path. If, however, the binary was linked with the <b>-z nodeflib</b>
      linker option, shared objects in the default paths are skipped. Shared
      objects installed in hardware capability directories (see below) are
      preferred to other shared objects.</dd>
  <dt>o</dt>
  <dd>In the default path <i>/lib</i>, and then <i>/usr/lib</i>. (On some 64-bit
      architectures, the default paths for 64-bit shared objects are
      <i>/lib64</i>, and then <i>/usr/lib64</i>.) If the binary was linked with
      the <b>-z nodeflib</b> linker option, this step is skipped.</dd>
</dl>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Rpath_token_expansion"><a class="permalink" href="#Rpath_token_expansion">Rpath
  token expansion</a></h2>
The dynamic linker understands certain token strings in an rpath specification
  (DT_RPATH or DT_RUNPATH). Those strings are substituted as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>$ORIGIN</i> (or equivalently <i>${ORIGIN}</i>)</dt>
  <dd>This expands to the directory containing the program or shared object.
      Thus, an application located in <i>somedir/app</i> could be compiled
    with</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
     gcc -Wl,-rpath,'$ORIGIN/../lib'</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>so that it finds an associated shared object in <i>somedir/lib</i> no
      matter where <i>somedir</i> is located in the directory hierarchy. This
      facilitates the creation of &quot;turn-key&quot; applications that do not
      need to be installed into special directories, but can instead be unpacked
      into any directory and still find their own shared objects.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>$LIB</i> (or equivalently <i>${LIB}</i>)</dt>
  <dd>This expands to <i>lib</i> or <i>lib64</i> depending on the architecture
      (e.g., on x86-64, it expands to <i>lib64</i> and on x86-32, it expands to

  <dt><i>$PLATFORM</i> (or equivalently <i>${PLATFORM}</i>)</dt>
  <dd>This expands to a string corresponding to the processor type of the host
      system (e.g., &quot;x86_64&quot;). On some architectures, the Linux kernel
      doesn't provide a platform string to the dynamic linker. The value of this
      string is taken from the <b>AT_PLATFORM</b> value in the auxiliary vector
      (see <b>getauxval</b>(3)).</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="permalink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
Various environment variables influence the operation of the dynamic linker.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Secure-execution_mode"><a class="permalink" href="#Secure-execution_mode">Secure-execution
  mode</a></h2>
For security reasons, if the dynamic linker determines that a binary should be
  run in secure-execution mode, the effects of some environment variables are
  voided or modified, and furthermore those environment variables are stripped
  from the environment, so that the program does not even see the definitions.
  Some of these environment variables affect the operation of the dynamic linker
  itself, and are described below. Other environment variables treated in this
  way include: <b>GCONV_PATH</b>, <b>GETCONF_DIR</b>, <b>HOSTALIASES</b>,
  <b>LOCALDOMAIN</b>, <b>LOCPATH</b>, <b>MALLOC_TRACE</b>, <b>NIS_PATH</b>,
  <b>NLSPATH</b>, <b>RESOLV_HOST_CONF</b>, <b>RES_OPTIONS</b>, <b>TMPDIR</b>,
  and <b>TZDIR</b>.
<p class="Pp">A binary is executed in secure-execution mode if the
    <b>AT_SECURE</b> entry in the auxiliary vector (see <b>getauxval</b>(3)) has
    a nonzero value. This entry may have a nonzero value for various reasons,
    including:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The process's real and effective user IDs differ, or the real and
      effective group IDs differ. This typically occurs as a result of executing
      a set-user-ID or set-group-ID program.</li>
  <li>A process with a non-root user ID executed a binary that conferred
      capabilities to the process.</li>
  <li>A nonzero value may have been set by a Linux Security Module.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Environment_variables"><a class="permalink" href="#Environment_variables">Environment
  variables</a></h2>
Among the more important environment variables are the following:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>LD_ASSUME_KERNEL</b> (since glibc 2.2.3)</dt>
  <dd>Each shared object can inform the dynamic linker of the minimum kernel ABI
      version that it requires. (This requirement is encoded in an ELF note
      section that is viewable via <i>readelf&#x00A0;-n</i> as a section labeled
      <b>NT_GNU_ABI_TAG</b>.) At run time, the dynamic linker determines the ABI
      version of the running kernel and will reject loading shared objects that
      specify minimum ABI versions that exceed that ABI version.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><b>LD_ASSUME_KERNEL</b> can be used to cause the dynamic linker to assume
      that it is running on a system with a different kernel ABI version. For
      example, the following command line causes the dynamic linker to assume it
      is running on Linux 2.2.5 when loading the shared objects required by
      <i>myprog</i>:</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    <pre>
$ <b>LD_ASSUME_KERNEL=2.2.5 ./myprog</b>

    </pre>
    <br/>
  </dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>On systems that provide multiple versions of a shared object (in different
      directories in the search path) that have different minimum kernel ABI
      version requirements, <b>LD_ASSUME_KERNEL</b> can be used to select the
      version of the object that is used (dependent on the directory search
      order).</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Historically, the most common use of the <b>LD_ASSUME_KERNEL</b> feature
      was to manually select the older LinuxThreads POSIX threads implementation
      on systems that provided both LinuxThreads and NPTL (which latter was
      typically the default on such systems); see <b>pthreads</b>(7).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>LD_BIND_NOW</b> (since glibc 2.1.1)</dt>
  <dd>If set to a nonempty string, causes the dynamic linker to resolve all
      symbols at program startup instead of deferring function call resolution
      to the point when they are first referenced. This is useful when using a
      debugger.</dd>
  <dt><b>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</b></dt>
  <dd>A list of directories in which to search for ELF libraries at execution
      time. The items in the list are separated by either colons or semicolons,

      <i>$PLATFORM</i> (or the versions using curly braces around the names) as
      described above in <i>Rpath token expansion</i>. Thus, for example, the
      following would cause a library to be searched for in either the
      <i>lib</i> or <i>lib64</i> subdirectory below the directory containing the
      program to be executed:</dd>

  <dd>A list of additional, user-specified, ELF shared objects to be loaded
      before all others. This feature can be used to selectively override
      functions in other shared objects.</dd>

      added to the link map in the left-to-right order specified in the
    list.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>In secure-execution mode, preload pathnames containing slashes are
      ignored. Furthermore, shared objects are preloaded only from the standard
      search directories and only if they have set-user-ID mode bit enabled
      (which is not typical).</dd>

  capabilities</a></h2>
Some shared objects are compiled using hardware-specific instructions which do
  not exist on every CPU. Such objects should be installed in directories whose
  names define the required hardware capabilities, such as
  <i>/usr/lib/sse2/</i>. The dynamic linker checks these directories against the
  hardware of the machine and selects the most suitable version of a given
  shared object. Hardware capability directories can be cascaded to combine CPU
  features. The list of supported hardware capability names depends on the CPU.
  The following names are currently recognized:
