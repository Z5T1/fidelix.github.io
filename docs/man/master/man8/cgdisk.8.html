GPT fdisk is a text-mode family of programs for creation and manipulation of
  partition tables. The <b>cgdisk</b> member of this family employs a
  curses-based user interface for interaction using a text-mode menuing system.
  It will automatically convert an old-style Master Boot Record (MBR) partition
  table or BSD disklabel stored without an MBR carrier partition to the newer
  Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) Partition Table (GPT) format, or will load a
  GUID partition table. Other members of this program family are <b>gdisk</b>
  (the most feature-rich program of the group, with a non-curses-based
  interactive user interface) and <b>sgdisk</b> (which is driven via
  command-line options for use by experts or in scripts). FixParts is a related
  program for fixing a limited set of problems with MBR disks.
<p class="Pp">For information on MBR vs. GPT, as well as GPT terminology and
    structure, see the extended GPT fdisk documentation at
    <i>http://www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/</i> or consult Wikipedia.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>cgdisk</b> program employs a user interface similar to that
    of Linux's <b>cfdisk</b>, but <b>cgdisk</b> modifies GPT partitions. It also
    has the capability of transforming MBR partitions or BSD disklabels into GPT
    partitions. Like the original <b>cfdisk</b> program, <b>cgdisk</b> does not
    modify disk structures until you explicitly write them to disk, so if you
    make a mistake, you can exit from the program with the Quit option to leave
    your partitions unmodified.</p>
<p class="Pp">Ordinarily, <b>cgdisk</b> operates on disk device files, such as
    <i>/dev/sda</i> or <i>/dev/hda</i> under Linux, <i>/dev/disk0</i> under Mac
    OS X, or <i>/dev/ad0</i> or <i>/dev/da0</i> under FreeBSD. The program can
    also operate on disk image files, which can be either copies of whole disks
    (made with <b>dd</b>, for instance) or raw disk images used by emulators
    such as QEMU or VMWare. Note that only <i>raw</i> disk images are supported;
    <b>cgdisk</b> cannot work on compressed or other advanced disk image
    formats.</p>
<p class="Pp">Upon start, <b>cgdisk</b> attempts to identify the partition type
    in use on the disk. If it finds valid GPT data, <b>cgdisk</b> will use it.
    If <b>cgdisk</b> finds a valid MBR or BSD disklabel but no GPT data, it will
    attempt to convert the MBR or disklabel into GPT form. (BSD disklabels are
    likely to have unusable first and/or final partitions because they overlap
    with the GPT data structures, though.) Upon exiting with the 'w' option,
    <b>cgdisk</b> replaces the MBR or disklabel with a GPT. <i>This action
    is</i> <i>potentially dangerous!</i> Your system may become unbootable, and
    partition type codes may become corrupted if the disk uses unrecognized type
    codes. Boot problems are particularly likely if you're multi-booting with
    any GPT-unaware OS. If you mistakenly launch <b>cgdisk</b> on an MBR disk,
    you can safely exit the program without making any changes by using the Quit
    option.</p>
<p class="Pp">When creating a fresh partition table, certain considerations may
    be in order:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>*</b></dt>
  <dd>For data (non-boot) disks, and for boot disks used on BIOS-based computers
      with GRUB as the boot loader, partitions may be created in whatever order
      and in whatever sizes are desired.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>*</b></dt>
  <dd>Boot disks for EFI-based systems require an <i>EFI System</i>
      <i>Partition</i> (GPT fdisk internal code 0xEF00) formatted as FAT-32. The
      recommended size of this partition is between 100 and 300 MiB.
      Boot-related files are stored here. (Note that GNU Parted identifies such
      partitions as having the &quot;boot flag&quot; set.)
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>*</b></dt>
  <dd>The GRUB 2 boot loader for BIOS-based systems makes use of a <i>BIOS
      Boot</i> <i>Partition</i> (GPT fdisk internal code 0xEF02), in which the
      secondary boot loader is stored, without the benefit of a filesystem. This
      partition can typically be quite small (roughly 32 KiB to 1 MiB), but you
      should consult your boot loader documentation for details.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>*</b></dt>
  <dd>If Windows is to boot from a GPT disk, a partition of type
      <i>Microsoft</i> <i>Reserved</i> (GPT fdisk internal code 0x0C01) is
      recommended. This partition should be about 128 MiB in size. It ordinarily
      follows the EFI System Partition and immediately precedes the Windows data
      partitions. (Note that old versions of GNU Parted create all FAT
      partitions as this type, which actually makes the partition unusable for
      normal file storage in both Windows and Mac OS X.)
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>*</b></dt>
  <dd>Some OSes' GPT utilities create some blank space (typically 128 MiB) after
      each partition. The intent is to enable future disk utilities to use this
      space. Such free space is not required of GPT disks, but creating it may
      help in future disk maintenance. You can use GPT fdisk's relative
      partition positioning option (specifying the starting sector as '+128M',
      for instance) to simplify creating such gaps.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
Only one command-line option is accepted, aside from the device filename:
  <i>-a</i>. This option alters the highlighting of partitions and blocks of
  free space: Instead of using ncurses, when <i>-a</i> is used <b>cgdisk</b>
  uses a &quot;&gt;&quot; symbol to the left of the selected partition or free
  space. This option is intended for use on limited display devices such as
  teletypes and screen readers.
<p class="Pp">Interactions with <b>cgdisk</b> occur with its interactive
    text-mode menus. The display is broken into two interactive parts:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>*</b></dt>
  <dd>The partition display area, in which partitions and gaps between them
      (marked as &quot;free space&quot;) are summarized.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>*</b></dt>
  <dd>The option selection area, in which buttons for the main options appear.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">In addition, the top of the display shows the program's name and
    version number, the device filename associated with the disk, and the disk's
    size in both sectors and IEEE-1541 units (GiB, TiB, and so on).</p>
<p class="Pp">You can use the following keys to move among the various options
    and to select among them:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>up arrow</b></dt>
  <dd>This key moves the partition selection up by one partition.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>down arrow</b></dt>
  <dd>This key moves the partition selection down by one partition.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Page Up</b></dt>
  <dd>This key moves the partition selection up by one screen.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Page Down</b></dt>
  <dd>This key moves the partition selection down by one screen.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>right arrow</b></dt>
  <dd>This key moves the option selection to the right by one item.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>left arrow</b></dt>
  <dd>This key moves the option selection to the left by one item.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Enter</b></dt>
  <dd>This key activates the currently selected option. You can also activate an
      option by typing the capitalized letter in the option's name on the
      keyboard, such as <b>a</b> to activate the Align option.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If more partitions exist than can be displayed in one screen, you
    can scroll between screens using the partition selection keys, much as in a
    text editor.</p>
<p class="Pp">Available options are as described below. (Note that <b>cgdisk</b>
    provides a much more limited set of options than its sibling <b>gdisk</b>.
    If you need to perform partition table recovery, hybrid MBR modifcation, or
    other advanced operations, you should consult the <b>gdisk</b>
    documentation.)</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>Align</b></dt>
  <dd>Change the sector alignment value. Disks with more logical sectors than
      physical sectors (such as modern Advanced Format drives), some RAID
      configurations, and many SSD devices, can suffer performance problems if
      partitions are not aligned properly for their internal data structures. On
      new disks, GPT fdisk attempts to align partitions on 1MiB boundaries
      (2048-sectors on disks with 512-byte sectors) by default, which optimizes
      performance for all of these disk types. On pre-partitioned disks, GPT
      fdisk attempts to identify the alignment value used on that disk, but will
      set 8-sector alignment on disks larger than 300 GB even if lesser
      alignment values are detected. In either case, it can be changed by using
      this option.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Backup</b></dt>
  <dd>Save partition data to a backup file. You can back up your current
      in-memory partition table to a disk file using this option. The resulting
      file is a binary file consisting of the protective MBR, the main GPT
      header, the backup GPT header, and one copy of the partition table, in
      that order. Note that the backup is of the current in-memory data
      structures, so if you launch the program, make changes, and then use this
      option, the backup will reflect your changes.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Delete</b></dt>
  <dd>Delete a partition. This action deletes the entry from the partition table
      but does not disturb the data within the sectors originally allocated to
      the partition on the disk. If a corresponding hybrid MBR partition exists,
      <b>gdisk</b> deletes it, as well, and expands any adjacent 0xEE (EFI GPT)
      MBR protective partition to fill the new free space.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Help</b></dt>
  <dd>Print brief descriptions of all the options.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Info</b></dt>
  <dd>Show detailed partition information. The summary information shown in the
      partition display area necessarily omits many details, such as the
      partitions' unique GUIDs and the partitions' sector-exact start and end
      points. The Info option displays this information for a single partition.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Load</b></dt>
  <dd>Load partition data from a backup file. This option is the reverse of the
      Backup option. Note that restoring partition data from anything but the
      original disk is not recommended.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>naMe</b></dt>
  <dd>Change the GPT name of a partition. This name is encoded as a UTF-16
      string, but proper entry and display of anything beyond basic ASCII values
      requires suitable locale and font support. For the most part, Linux
      ignores the partition name, but it may be important in some OSes. GPT
      fdisk sets a default name based on the partition type code. Note that the
      GPT partition name is different from the filesystem name, which is encoded
      in the filesystem's data structures. Note also that to activate this item
      by typing its alphabetic equivalent, you must use <b>M</b>, not the more
      obvious <b>N</b>, because the latter is used by the next option....
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>New</b></dt>
  <dd>Create a new partition. You enter a starting sector, a size, a type code,
      and a name. The start sector can be specified in absolute terms as a
      sector number or as a position measured in kibibytes (K), mebibytes (M),
      gibibytes (G), tebibytes (T), or pebibytes (P); for instance,
      <i></i><b>40M</b> specifies a position 40MiB from the start of the disk.
      You can specify locations relative to the start or end of the specified
      default range by preceding the number by a '+' symbol, as in
      <i></i><b>+2G</b> to specify a point 2GiB after the default start sector.
      The size value can use the K, M, G, T, and P suffixes, too. Pressing the
      Enter key with no input specifies the default value, which is the start of
      the largest available block for the start sector and the full available
      size for the size.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Quit</b></dt>
  <dd>Quit from the program <i>without saving your changes</i>. Use this option
      if you just wanted to view information or if you make a mistake and want
      to back out of all your changes.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Type</b></dt>
  <dd>Change a single partition's type code. You enter the type code using a
      two-byte hexadecimal number. You may also enter a GUID directly, if you
      have one and <b>cgdisk</b> doesn't know it. If you don't know the type
      code for your partition, you can type <b>L</b> to see a list of known type
      codes.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Verify</b></dt>
  <dd>Verify disk. This option checks for a variety of problems, such as
      incorrect CRCs and mismatched main and backup data. This option does not
      automatically correct most problems, though; for that, you must use
      <b>gdisk</b>. If no problems are found, this command displays a summary of
      unallocated disk space.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>Write</b></dt>
  <dd>Write data. Use this command to save your changes.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Known bugs and limitations include:
<p class="Pp"></p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>*</b></dt>
  <dd>The program compiles correctly only on Linux, FreeBSD, and Mac OS X. In
      theory, it should compile under Windows if the Ncurses library for Windows
      is installed, but I have not tested this capability. Linux versions for
      x86-64 (64-bit), x86 (32-bit), and PowerPC (32-bit) have been tested, with
      the x86-64 version having seen the most testing. Under FreeBSD, 32-bit
      (x86) and 64-bit (x86-64) versions have been tested. Only 32-bit versions
      for Mac OS X has been tested by the author.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>*</b></dt>
  <dd>The FreeBSD version of the program can't write changes to the partition
      table to a disk when existing partitions on that disk are mounted. (The
      same problem exists with many other FreeBSD utilities, such as <b>gpt</b>,
      <b>fdisk</b>, and <b>dd</b>.) This limitation can be overcome by typing
      <b>sysctl kern.geom.debugflags=16</b> at a shell prompt.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>*</b></dt>
  <dd>The program can load only up to 128 partitions (4 primary partitions and
      124 logical partitions) when converting from MBR format. This limit can be
      raised by changing the <i>#define MAX_MBR_PARTS</i> line in the
      <i>basicmbr.h</i> source code file and recompiling; however, such a change
      will require using a larger-than-normal partition table. (The limit of 128
      partitions was chosen because that number equals the 128 partitions
      supported by the most common partition table size.)
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>*</b></dt>
  <dd>Converting from MBR format sometimes fails because of insufficient space
      at the start or (more commonly) the end of the disk. Resizing the
      partition table (using the 's' option in the experts' menu in
      <b>gdisk</b>) can sometimes overcome this problem; however, in extreme
      cases it may be necessary to resize a partition using GNU Parted or a
      similar tool prior to conversion with GPT fdisk.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>*</b></dt>
  <dd>MBR conversions work only if the disk has correct LBA partition
      descriptors. These descriptors should be present on any disk over 8 GiB in
      size or on smaller disks partitioned with any but very ancient software.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>*</b></dt>
  <dd>BSD disklabel support can create first and/or last partitions that overlap
      with the GPT data structures. This can sometimes be compensated by
      adjusting the partition table size, but in extreme cases the affected
      partition(s) may need to be deleted.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>*</b></dt>
  <dd>Because of the highly variable nature of BSD disklabel structures,
      conversions from this form may be unreliable -- partitions may be dropped,
      converted in a way that creates overlaps with other partitions, or
      converted with incorrect start or end values. Use this feature with
      caution!
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>*</b></dt>
  <dd>Booting after converting an MBR or BSD disklabel disk is likely to be
      disrupted. Sometimes re-installing a boot loader will fix the problem, but
      other times you may need to switch boot loaders. Except on EFI-based
      platforms, Windows through at least Windows 7 doesn't support booting from
      GPT disks. Creating a hybrid MBR (using the 'h' option on the recovery
      &amp; transformation menu in <b>gdisk</b>) or abandoning GPT in favor of
      MBR may be your only options in this case.
    <p class="Pp"></p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>*</b></dt>
  <dd>The <b>cgdisk</b> Verify function and the partition type listing
      obtainable by typing <i>L</i> in the Type function (or when specifying a
      partition type while creating a new partition) both currently exit ncurses
      mode. This limitation is a minor cosmetic blemish that does not affect
      functionality.
