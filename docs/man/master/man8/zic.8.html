</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The input specifies a link to a link.</p>
<p class="Pp">A year that appears in a data file is outside the range of
    representable years.</p>
<p class="Pp">A time of 24:00 or more appears in the input. Pre-1998 versions of
    <b>zic</b> prohibit 24:00, and pre-2007 versions prohibit times greater than
    24:00.</p>
<p class="Pp">A rule goes past the start or end of the month. Pre-2004 versions
    of <b>zic</b> prohibit this.</p>
<p class="Pp">A time zone abbreviation uses a <b>%z</b> format. Pre-2015
    versions of <b>zic</b> do not support this.</p>
<p class="Pp">A timestamp contains fractional seconds. Pre-2018 versions of
    <b>zic</b> do not support this.</p>
<p class="Pp">The input contains abbreviations that are mishandled by pre-2018
    versions of <b>zic</b> due to a longstanding coding bug. These abbreviations
    include &#x201C;L&#x201D; for &#x201C;Link&#x201D;, &#x201C;mi&#x201D; for
    &#x201C;min&#x201D;, &#x201C;Sa&#x201D; for &#x201C;Sat&#x201D;, and
    &#x201C;Su&#x201D; for &#x201C;Sun&#x201D;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The output file does not contain all the information about the
    long-term future of a timezone, because the future cannot be summarized as
    an extended POSIX TZ string. For example, as of 2019 this problem occurs for
    Iran's daylight-saving rules for the predicted future, as these rules are
    based on the Iranian calendar, which cannot be represented.</p>
<p class="Pp">The output contains data that may not be handled properly by
    client code designed for older <b>zic</b> output formats. These
    compatibility issues affect only timestamps before 1970 or after the start
    of 2038.</p>
<p class="Pp">The output file contains more than 1200 transitions, which may be
    mishandled by some clients. The current reference client supports at most
    2000 transitions; pre-2014 versions of the reference client support at most
    1200 transitions.</p>
<p class="Pp">A time zone abbreviation has fewer than 3 or more than 6
    characters. POSIX requires at least 3, and requires implementations to
    support at least 6.</p>
<p class="Pp">An output file name contains a byte that is not an ASCII letter,
    &#x201C;<span class="Li">-</span>&#x201D;, &#x201C;/&#x201D;, or
    &#x201C;_&#x201D;; or it contains a file name component that contains more
    than 14 bytes or that starts with
  &#x201C;<span class="Li">-</span>&#x201D;.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="FILES"><a class="permalink" href="#FILES">FILES</a></h1>
Input files use the format described in this section; output files use
  <i>tzfile</i>(5) format.
<p class="Pp">Input files should be text files, that is, they should be a series
    of zero or more lines, each ending in a newline byte and containing at most
    511 bytes, and without any NUL bytes. The input text's encoding is typically
    UTF-8 or ASCII; it should have a unibyte representation for the POSIX
    Portable Character Set (PPCS)
    &#x27E8;http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap06.html&#x27E9;
    and the encoding's non-unibyte characters should consist entirely of
    non-PPCS bytes. Non-PPCS characters typically occur only in comments:
    although output file names and time zone abbreviations can contain nearly
    any character, other software will work better if these are limited to the
    restricted syntax described under the <b><span class="Li">-</span>v</b>
    option.</p>
<p class="Pp">Input lines are made up of fields. Fields are separated from one
    another by one or more white space characters. The white space characters
    are space, form feed, carriage return, newline, tab, and vertical tab.
    Leading and trailing white space on input lines is ignored. An unquoted
    sharp character (#) in the input introduces a comment which extends to the
    end of the line the sharp character appears on. White space characters and
    sharp characters may be enclosed in double quotes (&quot;) if they're to be
    used as part of a field. Any line that is blank (after comment stripping) is
    ignored. Nonblank lines are expected to be of one of three types: rule
    lines, zone lines, and link lines.</p>
<p class="Pp">Names must be in English and are case insensitive. They appear in
    several contexts, and include month and weekday names and keywords such as
    <b>maximum</b>, <b>only</b>, <b>Rolling</b>, and <b>Zone</b>. A name can be
    abbreviated by omitting all but an initial prefix; any abbreviation must be
    unambiguous in context.</p>
<p class="Pp">A rule line has the form</p>
<pre>

Rule	NAME	FROM	TO	TYPE	IN	ON	AT	SAVE	LETTER/S

For example:

Rule	US	1967	1973	<span class="Li">-</span>	Apr	lastSun	2:00w	1:00d	D

</pre>
The fields that make up a rule line are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>NAME</b></dt>
  <dd>Gives the name of the rule set that contains this line. The name must
      start with a character that is neither an ASCII digit nor
      &#x201C;<span class="Li">-</span>&#x201D; nor &#x201C;+&#x201D;. To allow
      for future extensions, an unquoted name should not contain characters from
      the set &#x201C;!$%&amp;'()*,/:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\]^`{|}~&#x201D;.</dd>
  <dt><b>FROM</b></dt>
  <dd>Gives the first year in which the rule applies. Any signed integer year
      can be supplied; the proleptic Gregorian calendar is assumed, with year 0
      preceding year 1. The word <b>minimum</b> (or an abbreviation) means the
      indefinite past. The word <b>maximum</b> (or an abbreviation) means the
      indefinite future. Rules can describe times that are not representable as
      time values, with the unrepresentable times ignored; this allows rules to
      be portable among hosts with differing time value types.</dd>
  <dt><b>TO</b></dt>
  <dd>Gives the final year in which the rule applies. In addition to
      <b>minimum</b> and <b>maximum</b> (as above), the word <b>only</b> (or an
      abbreviation) may be used to repeat the value of the <b>FROM</b>
    field.</dd>
  <dt><b>TYPE</b></dt>
  <dd>should be &#x201C;<span class="Li">-</span>&#x201D; and is present for
      compatibility with older versions of <b>zic</b> in which it could contain
      year types.</dd>
  <dt><b>IN</b></dt>
  <dd>Names the month in which the rule takes effect. Month names may be
      abbreviated.</dd>
  <dt><b>ON</b></dt>
  <dd>Gives the day on which the rule takes effect. Recognized forms include:
    <pre>
<br/>


5	the fifth of the month
lastSun	the last Sunday in the month
lastMon	the last Monday in the month
Sun&gt;=8	first Sunday on or after the eighth
Sun&lt;=25	last Sunday on or before the 25th
    </pre>
    <br/>
    <p class="Pp">A weekday name (e.g., <b>Sunday</b>) or a weekday name
        preceded by &#x201C;last&#x201D; (e.g., <b>lastSunday</b>) may be
        abbreviated or spelled out in full. There must be no white space
        characters within the <b>ON</b> field. The &#x201C;&lt;=&#x201D; and
        &#x201C;&gt;=&#x201D; constructs can result in a day in the neighboring
        month; for example, the IN-ON combination &#x201C;Oct Sun&gt;=31&#x201D;
        stands for the first Sunday on or after October 31, even if that Sunday
        occurs in November.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>AT</b></dt>
  <dd>Gives the time of day at which the rule takes effect, relative to 00:00,
      the start of a calendar day. Recognized forms include:
    <pre>
<br/>


2	time in hours
2:00	time in hours and minutes
01:28:14	time in hours, minutes, and seconds
00:19:32.13	time with fractional seconds
12:00	midday, 12 hours after 00:00
15:00	3 PM, 15 hours after 00:00
24:00	end of day, 24 hours after 00:00
260:00	260 hours after 00:00
<span class="Li">-</span>2:30	2.5 hours before 00:00
<span class="Li">-</span>	equivalent to 0
    </pre>
    <br/>
    <p class="Pp">Although <b>zic</b> rounds times to the nearest integer second
        (breaking ties to the even integer), the fractions may be useful to
        other applications requiring greater precision. The source format does
        not specify any maximum precision. Any of these forms may be followed by
        the letter <b>w</b> if the given time is local or &#x201C;wall
        clock&#x201D; time, <b>s</b> if the given time is standard time without
        any adjustment for daylight saving, or <b>u</b> (or <b>g</b> or
        <b>z</b>) if the given time is universal time; in the absence of an
        indicator, local (wall clock) time is assumed. These forms ignore leap
        seconds; for example, if a leap second occurs at 00:59:60 local time,
        &#x201C;1:00&#x201D; stands for 3601 seconds after local midnight
        instead of the usual 3600 seconds. The intent is that a rule line
        describes the instants when a clock/calendar set to the type of time
        specified in the <b>AT</b> field would show the specified date and time
        of day.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>SAVE</b></dt>
  <dd>Gives the amount of time to be added to local standard time when the rule
      is in effect, and whether the resulting time is standard or daylight
      saving. This field has the same format as the <b>AT</b> field except with
      a different set of suffix letters: <b>s</b> for standard time and <b>d</b>
      for daylight saving time. The suffix letter is typically omitted, and
      defaults to <b>s</b> if the offset is zero and to <b>d</b> otherwise.
      Negative offsets are allowed; in Ireland, for example, daylight saving
      time is observed in winter and has a negative offset relative to Irish
      Standard Time. The offset is merely added to standard time; for example,
      <b>zic</b> does not distinguish a 10:30 standard time plus an 0:30
      <b>SAVE</b> from a 10:00 standard time plus a 1:00 <b>SAVE</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>LETTER/S</b></dt>
  <dd>Gives the &#x201C;variable part&#x201D; (for example, the
      &#x201C;S&#x201D; or &#x201C;D&#x201D; in &#x201C;EST&#x201D; or
      &#x201C;EDT&#x201D;) of time zone abbreviations to be used when this rule
      is in effect. If this field is &#x201C;<span class="Li">-</span>&#x201D;,
      the variable part is null.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">A zone line has the form</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
Zone	NAME	STDOFF	RULES	FORMAT	[UNTIL]

For example:

Zone	Asia/Amman	2:00	Jordan	EE%sT	2017 Oct 27 01:00

</pre>
The fields that make up a zone line are:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>NAME</b></dt>
  <dd>The name of the timezone. This is the name used in creating the time
      conversion information file for the timezone. It should not contain a file
      name component &#x201C;.&#x201D; or &#x201C;..&#x201D;; a file name
      component is a maximal substring that does not contain
    &#x201C;/&#x201D;.</dd>
  <dt><b>STDOFF</b></dt>
  <dd>The amount of time to add to UT to get standard time, without any
      adjustment for daylight saving. This field has the same format as the
      <b>AT</b> and <b>SAVE</b> fields of rule lines; begin the field with a
      minus sign if time must be subtracted from UT.</dd>
  <dt><b>RULES</b></dt>
  <dd>The name of the rules that apply in the timezone or, alternatively, a
      field in the same format as a rule-line SAVE column, giving of the amount
      of time to be added to local standard time effect, and whether the
      resulting time is standard or daylight saving. If this field is
      <b><span class="Li">-</span></b> then standard time always applies. When
      an amount of time is given, only the sum of standard time and this amount
      matters.</dd>
  <dt><b>FORMAT</b></dt>
  <dd>The format for time zone abbreviations. The pair of characters <b>%s</b>
      is used to show where the &#x201C;variable part&#x201D; of the time zone
      abbreviation goes. Alternatively, a format can use the pair of characters
      <b>%z</b> to stand for the UT offset in the form &#x00B1;<i>hh</i>,
      &#x00B1;<i>hhmm</i>, or &#x00B1;<i>hhmmss</i>, using the shortest form
      that does not lose information, where <i>hh</i>, <i>mm</i>, and <i>ss</i>
      are the hours, minutes, and seconds east (+) or west (&#x2212;) of UT.
      Alternatively, a slash (/) separates standard and daylight abbreviations.
      To conform to POSIX, a time zone abbreviation should contain only
      alphanumeric ASCII characters, &#x201C;+&#x201D; and
      &#x201C;<span class="Li">-</span>&#x201D;.</dd>
  <dt><b>UNTIL</b></dt>
  <dd>The time at which the UT offset or the rule(s) change for a location. It
      takes the form of one to four fields YEAR [MONTH [DAY [TIME]]]. If this is
      specified, the time zone information is generated from the given UT offset
      and rule change until the time specified, which is interpreted using the
      rules in effect just before the transition. The month, day, and time of
      day have the same format as the IN, ON, and AT fields of a rule; trailing
      fields can be omitted, and default to the earliest possible value for the
      missing fields.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The next line must be a &#x201C;continuation&#x201D; line; this has the
      same form as a zone line except that the string &#x201C;Zone&#x201D; and
      the name are omitted, as the continuation line will place information
      starting at the time specified as the &#x201C;until&#x201D; information in
      the previous line in the file used by the previous line. Continuation
      lines may contain &#x201C;until&#x201D; information, just as zone lines
      do, indicating that the next line is a further continuation.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If a zone changes at the same instant that a rule would otherwise
    take effect in the earlier zone or continuation line, the rule is ignored. A
    zone or continuation line <i>L</i> with a named rule set starts with
    standard time by default: that is, any of <i>L</i>'s timestamps preceding
    <i>L</i>'s earliest rule use the rule in effect after <i>L</i>'s first
    transition into standard time. In a single zone it is an error if two rules
    take effect at the same instant, or if two zone changes take effect at the
    same instant.</p>
<p class="Pp">A link line has the form</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
Link	TARGET	LINK-NAME

For example:

Link	Europe/Istanbul	Asia/Istanbul

</pre>
The <b>TARGET</b> field should appear as the <b>NAME</b> field in some zone
  line. The <b>LINK-NAME</b> field is used as an alternative name for that zone;
  it has the same syntax as a zone line's <b>NAME</b> field.
<p class="Pp">Except for continuation lines, lines may appear in any order in
    the input. However, the behavior is unspecified if multiple zone or link
    lines define the same name, or if the source of one link line is the target
    of another.</p>
<p class="Pp">The file that describes leap seconds can have leap lines and an
    expiration line. Leap lines have the following form:</p>
<pre>

Leap	YEAR	MONTH	DAY	HH:MM:SS	CORR	R/S

For example:

Leap	2016	Dec	31	23:59:60	+	S

</pre>
The <b>YEAR</b>, <b>MONTH</b>, <b>DAY</b>, and <b>HH:MM:SS</b> fields tell when
  the leap second happened. The <b>CORR</b> field should be &#x201C;+&#x201D; if
  a second was added or &#x201C;<span class="Li">-</span>&#x201D; if a second
  was skipped. The <b>R/S</b> field should be (an abbreviation of)
  &#x201C;Stationary&#x201D; if the leap second time given by the other fields
  should be interpreted as UTC or (an abbreviation of) &#x201C;Rolling&#x201D;
  if the leap second time given by the other fields should be interpreted as
  local (wall clock) time.
<p class="Pp">The expiration line, if present, has the form:</p>
<pre>

Expires	YEAR	MONTH	DAY	HH:MM:SS

For example:

Expires	2020	Dec	28	00:00:00

</pre>
The <b>YEAR</b>, <b>MONTH</b>, <b>DAY</b>, and <b>HH:MM:SS</b> fields give the
  expiration timestamp in UTC for the leap second table; <b>zic</b> outputs this
  expiration timestamp by truncating the end of the output file to the
  timestamp. If there is no expiration line, <b>zic</b> also accepts a comment
  &#x201C;#expires <i>E</i> ...&#x201D; where <i>E</i> is the expiration
  timestamp as a decimal integer count of seconds since the Epoch, not counting
  leap seconds. However, the &#x201C;#expires&#x201D; comment is an obsolescent
  feature, and the leap second file should use an expiration line instead of
  relying on a comment.

In this example, the timezone is named Europe/Zurich but it has an alias as
  Europe/Vaduz. This example says that Zurich was 34 minutes and 8 seconds east
  of UT until 1853-07-16 at 00:00, when the legal offset was changed to
  7&#x00B0;26&#x2032;22.50&#x2033;, which works out to 0:29:45.50; <b>zic</b>
  treats this by rounding it to 0:29:46. After 1894-06-01 at 00:00 the UT offset
  became one hour and Swiss daylight saving rules (defined with lines beginning
  with &#x201C;Rule Swiss&#x201D;) apply. From 1981 to the present, EU daylight
  saving rules have applied, and the UTC offset has remained at one hour.
<p class="Pp">In 1941 and 1942, daylight saving time applied from the first
    Monday in May at 01:00 to the first Monday in October at 02:00. The pre-1981
    EU daylight-saving rules have no effect here, but are included for
    completeness. Since 1981, daylight saving has begun on the last Sunday in
    March at 01:00 UTC. Until 1995 it ended the last Sunday in September at
    01:00 UTC, but this changed to the last Sunday in October starting in
  1996.</p>
<p class="Pp">For purposes of display, &#x201C;LMT&#x201D; and
    &#x201C;BMT&#x201D; were initially used, respectively. Since Swiss rules and
    later EU rules were applied, the time zone abbreviation has been CET for
    standard time and CEST for daylight saving time.</p>

For areas with more than two types of local time, you may need to use local
  standard time in the <b>AT</b> field of the earliest transition time's rule to
  ensure that the earliest transition time recorded in the compiled file is
  correct.
<p class="Pp">If, for a particular timezone, a clock advance caused by the start
    of daylight saving coincides with and is equal to a clock retreat caused by
    a change in UT offset, <b>zic</b> produces a single transition to daylight
    saving at the new UT offset without any change in local (wall clock) time.
    To get separate transitions use multiple zone continuation lines specifying
    transition instants using universal time.</p>
