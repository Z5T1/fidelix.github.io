perldelta - what is new for perl v5.30.3

This document describes differences between the 5.30.2 release and the 5.30.3
  release.
<p class="Pp">If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.30.1, first
    read perl5302delta, which describes differences between 5.30.1 and
  5.30.2.</p>

  Buffer overflow caused by a crafted regular expression</a></h2>
A signed <span class="Li">&quot;size_t&quot;</span> integer overflow in the
  storage space calculations for nested regular expression quantifiers could
  cause a heap buffer overflow in Perl's regular expression compiler that
  overwrites memory allocated after the regular expression storage space with
  attacker supplied data.
<p class="Pp">The target system needs a sufficient amount of memory to allocate
    partial expansions of the nested quantifiers prior to the overflow
    occurring. This requirement is unlikely to be met on 64-bit systems.</p>

    Vingroup).</p>

  Integer overflow via malformed bytecode produced by a crafted regular
  expression</a></h2>
Integer overflows in the calculation of offsets between instructions for the
  regular expression engine could cause corruption of the intermediate language
  state of a compiled regular expression. An attacker could abuse this behaviour
  to insert instructions into the compiled form of a Perl regular expression.

  Buffer overflow caused by a crafted regular expression</a></h2>
Recursive calls to <span class="Li">&quot;S_study_chunk()&quot;</span> by Perl's
  regular expression compiler to optimize the intermediate language
  representation of a regular expression could cause corruption of the
  intermediate language state of a compiled regular expression.

<h2 class="Ss" id="Additional_Note"><a class="permalink" href="#Additional_Note">Additional
  Note</a></h2>
An application written in Perl would only be vulnerable to any of the above
  flaws if it evaluates regular expressions supplied by the attacker. Evaluating
  regular expressions in this fashion is known to be dangerous since the regular
  expression engine does not protect against denial of service attacks in this
  usage scenario.

Perl 5.30.3 represents approximately 3 months of development since Perl 5.30.2
  and contains approximately 1,100 lines of changes across 42 files from 7
  authors.
<p class="Pp">Excluding auto-generated files, documentation and release tools,
    there were approximately 350 lines of changes to 8 .pm, .t, .c and .h
  files.</p>
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to flourish into its fourth decade thanks to a
    vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.30.3:</p>
<p class="Pp">Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Hugo van der Sanden, John Lightsey, Karl
    Williamson, Nicolas R., Sawyer X, Steve Hay.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is
    automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does
    not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many of the changes included in this version originated in the
    CPAN modules included in Perl's core. We're grateful to the entire CPAN
    community for helping Perl to flourish.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,
    please see the <i>AUTHORS</i> file in the Perl source distribution.</p>

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the perl bug database at
  &lt;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/issues&gt;. There may also be information at
  &lt;https://www.perl.org/&gt;, the Perl Home Page.
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please open an issue at
