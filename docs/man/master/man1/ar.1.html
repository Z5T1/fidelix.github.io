The GNU <b>ar</b> program creates, modifies, and extracts from archives. An
  <i>archive</i> is a single file holding a collection of other files in a
  structure that makes it possible to retrieve the original individual files
  (called <i>members</i> of the archive).
<p class="Pp">The original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp,
    owner, and group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on
    extraction.</p>
<p class="Pp">GNU <b>ar</b> can maintain archives whose members have names of
    any length; however, depending on how <b>ar</b> is configured on your
    system, a limit on member-name length may be imposed for compatibility with
    archive formats maintained with other tools. If it exists, the limit is
    often 15 characters (typical of formats related to a.out) or 16 characters
    (typical of formats related to coff).</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>ar</b> is considered a binary utility because archives of this
    sort are most often used as <i>libraries</i> holding commonly needed
    subroutines.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>ar</b> creates an index to the symbols defined in relocatable
    object modules in the archive when you specify the modifier <b>s</b>. Once
    created, this index is updated in the archive whenever <b>ar</b> makes a
    change to its contents (save for the <b>q</b> update operation). An archive
    with such an index speeds up linking to the library, and allows routines in
    the library to call each other without regard to their placement in the
    archive.</p>
<p class="Pp">You may use <b>nm -s</b> or <b>nm --print-armap</b> to list this
    index table. If an archive lacks the table, another form of <b>ar</b> called
    <b>ranlib</b> can be used to add just the table.</p>
<p class="Pp">GNU <b>ar</b> can optionally create a <i>thin</i> archive, which
    contains a symbol index and references to the original copies of the member
    files of the archive. This is useful for building libraries for use within a
    local build tree, where the relocatable objects are expected to remain
    available, and copying the contents of each object would only waste time and
    space.</p>
<p class="Pp">An archive can either be <i>thin</i> or it can be normal. It
    cannot be both at the same time. Once an archive is created its format
    cannot be changed without first deleting it and then creating a new archive
    in its place.</p>
<p class="Pp">Thin archives are also <i>flattened</i>, so that adding one thin
    archive to another thin archive does not nest it, as would happen with a
    normal archive. Instead the elements of the first archive are added
    individually to the second archive.</p>
<p class="Pp">The paths to the elements of the archive are stored relative to
    the archive itself.</p>
<p class="Pp">GNU <b>ar</b> is designed to be compatible with two different
    facilities. You can control its activity using command-line options, like
    the different varieties of <b>ar</b> on Unix systems; or, if you specify the
    single command-line option <b>-M</b>, you can control it with a script
    supplied via standard input, like the MRI &quot;librarian&quot; program.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
GNU <b>ar</b> allows you to mix the operation code <i>p</i> and modifier flags
  <i>mod</i> in any order, within the first command-line argument.
<p class="Pp">If you wish, you may begin the first command-line argument with a
    dash.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>p</i> keyletter specifies what operation to execute; it may
    be any of the following, but you must specify only one of them:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>d</b></dt>
  <dd><i>Delete</i> modules from the archive. Specify the names of modules to be
      deleted as <i>member</i>...; the archive is untouched if you specify no
      files to delete.
    <p class="Pp">If you specify the <b>v</b> modifier, <b>ar</b> lists each
        module as it is deleted.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>m</b></dt>
  <dd>Use this operation to <i>move</i> members in an archive.
    <p class="Pp">The ordering of members in an archive can make a difference in
        how programs are linked using the library, if a symbol is defined in
        more than one member.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If no modifiers are used with
        <span class="Li">&quot;m&quot;</span>, any members you name in the
        <i>member</i> arguments are moved to the <i>end</i> of the archive; you
        can use the <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, or <b>i</b> modifiers to move them to a
        specified place instead.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>p</b></dt>
  <dd><i>Print</i> the specified members of the archive, to the standard output
      file. If the <b>v</b> modifier is specified, show the member name before
      copying its contents to standard output.
    <p class="Pp">If you specify no <i>member</i> arguments, all the files in
        the archive are printed.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>q</b></dt>
  <dd><i>Quick append</i>; Historically, add the files <i>member</i>... to the
      end of <i>archive</i>, without checking for replacement.
    <p class="Pp">The modifiers <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, and <b>i</b> do <i>not</i>
        affect this operation; new members are always placed at the end of the
        archive.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The modifier <b>v</b> makes <b>ar</b> list each file as it is
        appended.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Since the point of this operation is speed, implementations of
        <b>ar</b> have the option of not updating the archive's symbol table if
        one exists. Too many different systems however assume that symbol tables
        are always up-to-date, so GNU <b>ar</b> will rebuild the table even with
        a quick append.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note - GNU <b>ar</b> treats the command <b>qs</b> as a synonym
        for <b>r</b> - replacing already existing files in the archive and
        appending new ones at the end.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>r</b></dt>
  <dd>Insert the files <i>member</i>... into <i>archive</i> (with
      <i>replacement</i>). This operation differs from <b>q</b> in that any
      previously existing members are deleted if their names match those being
      added.
    <p class="Pp">If one of the files named in <i>member</i>... does not exist,
        <b>ar</b> displays an error message, and leaves undisturbed any existing
        members of the archive matching that name.</p>
    <p class="Pp">By default, new members are added at the end of the file; but
        you may use one of the modifiers <b>a</b>, <b>b</b>, or <b>i</b> to
        request placement relative to some existing member.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The modifier <b>v</b> used with this operation elicits a line
        of output for each file inserted, along with one of the letters <b>a</b>
        or <b>r</b> to indicate whether the file was appended (no old member
        deleted) or replaced.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>s</b></dt>
  <dd>Add an index to the archive, or update it if it already exists. Note this
      command is an exception to the rule that there can only be one command
      letter, as it is possible to use it as either a command or a modifier. In
      either case it does the same thing.</dd>
  <dt><b>t</b></dt>
  <dd>Display a <i>table</i> listing the contents of <i>archive</i>, or those of
      the files listed in <i>member</i>... that are present in the archive.
      Normally only the member name is shown, but if the modifier <b>O</b> is
      specified, then the corresponding offset of the member is also displayed.
      Finally, in order to see the modes (permissions), timestamp, owner, group,
      and size the <b>v</b> modifier should be included.
    <p class="Pp">If you do not specify a <i>member</i>, all files in the
        archive are listed.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If there is more than one file with the same name (say,
        <b>fie</b>) in an archive (say <b>b.a</b>), <b>ar t b.a fie</b> lists
        only the first instance; to see them all, you must ask for a complete
        listing---in our example, <b>ar t b.a</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>x</b></dt>
  <dd><i>Extract</i> members (named <i>member</i>) from the archive. You can use
      the <b>v</b> modifier with this operation, to request that <b>ar</b> list
      each name as it extracts it.
    <p class="Pp">If you do not specify a <i>member</i>, all files in the
        archive are extracted.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Files cannot be extracted from a thin archive, and there are
        restrictions on extracting from archives created with <b>P</b>: The
        paths must not be absolute, may not contain
        <span class="Li">&quot;..&quot;</span>, and any subdirectories in the
        paths must exist. If it is desired to avoid these restrictions then used
        the <b>--output</b> option to specify an output directory.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">A number of modifiers (<i>mod</i>) may immediately follow the
    <i>p</i> keyletter, to specify variations on an operation's behavior:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>a</b></dt>
  <dd>Add new files <i>after</i> an existing member of the archive. If you use
      the modifier <b>a</b>, the name of an existing archive member must be
      present as the <i>relpos</i> argument, before the <i>archive</i>
      specification.</dd>
  <dt><b>b</b></dt>
  <dd>Add new files <i>before</i> an existing member of the archive. If you use
      the modifier <b>b</b>, the name of an existing archive member must be
      present as the <i>relpos</i> argument, before the <i>archive</i>
      specification. (same as <b>i</b>).</dd>
  <dt><b>c</b></dt>
  <dd><i>Create</i> the archive. The specified <i>archive</i> is always created
      if it did not exist, when you request an update. But a warning is issued
      unless you specify in advance that you expect to create it, by using this
      modifier.</dd>
  <dt><b>D</b></dt>
  <dd>Operate in <i>deterministic</i> mode. When adding files and the archive
      index use zero for UIDs, GIDs, timestamps, and use consistent file modes
      for all files. When this option is used, if <b>ar</b> is used with
      identical options and identical input files, multiple runs will create
      identical output files regardless of the input files' owners, groups, file
      modes, or modification times.
    <p class="Pp">If <i>binutils</i> was configured with
        <b>--enable-deterministic-archives</b>, then this mode is on by default.
        It can be disabled with the <b>U</b> modifier, below.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>f</b></dt>
  <dd>Truncate names in the archive. GNU <b>ar</b> will normally permit file
      names of any length. This will cause it to create archives which are not
      compatible with the native <b>ar</b> program on some systems. If this is a
      concern, the <b>f</b> modifier may be used to truncate file names when
      putting them in the archive.</dd>
  <dt><b>i</b></dt>
  <dd>Insert new files <i>before</i> an existing member of the archive. If you
      use the modifier <b>i</b>, the name of an existing archive member must be
      present as the <i>relpos</i> argument, before the <i>archive</i>
      specification. (same as <b>b</b>).</dd>
  <dt><b>l</b></dt>
  <dd>This modifier is accepted but not used.</dd>
  <dt><b>N</b></dt>
  <dd>Uses the <i>count</i> parameter. This is used if there are multiple
      entries in the archive with the same name. Extract or delete instance
      <i>count</i> of the given name from the archive.</dd>
  <dt><b>o</b></dt>
  <dd>Preserve the <i>original</i> dates of members when extracting them. If you
      do not specify this modifier, files extracted from the archive are stamped
      with the time of extraction.</dd>
  <dt><b>O</b></dt>
  <dd>Display member offsets inside the archive. Use together with the <b>t</b>
      option.</dd>
  <dt><b>P</b></dt>
  <dd>Use the full path name when matching or storing names in the archive.
      Archives created with full path names are not POSIX compliant, and thus
      may not work with tools other than up to date GNU tools. Modifying such
      archives with GNU <b>ar</b> without using <b>P</b> will remove the full
      path names unless the archive is a thin archive. Note that <b>P</b> may be
      useful when adding files to a thin archive since <b>r</b> without <b>P</b>
      ignores the path when choosing which element to replace. Thus
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        ar rcST archive.a subdir/file1 subdir/file2 file1
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will result in the first
        <span class="Li">&quot;subdir/file1&quot;</span> being replaced with
        <span class="Li">&quot;file1&quot;</span> from the current directory.
        Adding <b>P</b> will prevent this replacement.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>s</b></dt>
  <dd>Write an object-file index into the archive, or update an existing one,
      even if no other change is made to the archive. You may use this modifier
      flag either with any operation, or alone. Running <b>ar s</b> on an
      archive is equivalent to running <b>ranlib</b> on it.</dd>
  <dt><b>S</b></dt>
  <dd>Do not generate an archive symbol table. This can speed up building a
      large library in several steps. The resulting archive can not be used with
      the linker. In order to build a symbol table, you must omit the <b>S</b>
      modifier on the last execution of <b>ar</b>, or you must run <b>ranlib</b>
      on the archive.</dd>
  <dt><b>T</b></dt>
  <dd>Make the specified <i>archive</i> a <i>thin</i> archive. If it already
      exists and is a regular archive, the existing members must be present in
      the same directory as <i>archive</i>.</dd>
  <dt><b>u</b></dt>
  <dd>Normally, <b>ar r</b>... inserts all files listed into the archive. If you
      would like to insert <i>only</i> those of the files you list that are
      newer than existing members of the same names, use this modifier. The
      <b>u</b> modifier is allowed only for the operation <b>r</b> (replace). In
      particular, the combination <b>qu</b> is not allowed, since checking the
      timestamps would lose any speed advantage from the operation
    <b>q</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>U</b></dt>
  <dd>Do <i>not</i> operate in <i>deterministic</i> mode. This is the inverse of
      the <b>D</b> modifier, above: added files and the archive index will get
      their actual UID, GID, timestamp, and file mode values.
    <p class="Pp">This is the default unless <i>binutils</i> was configured with
        <b>--enable-deterministic-archives</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>v</b></dt>
  <dd>This modifier requests the <i>verbose</i> version of an operation. Many
      operations display additional information, such as filenames processed,
      when the modifier <b>v</b> is appended.</dd>
  <dt><b>V</b></dt>
  <dd>This modifier shows the version number of <b>ar</b>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">The <b>ar</b> program also supports some command-line options
    which are neither modifiers nor actions, but which do change its behaviour
    in specific ways:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>--help</b></dt>
  <dd>Displays the list of command-line options supported by <b>ar</b> and then
      exits.</dd>
  <dt><b>--version</b></dt>
  <dd>Displays the version information of <b>ar</b> and then exits.</dd>
  <dt><b>-X32_64</b></dt>
  <dd><b>ar</b> ignores an initial option spelled <b>-X32_64</b>, for
      compatibility with AIX. The behaviour produced by this option is the
      default for GNU <b>ar</b>. <b>ar</b> does not support any of the other
      <b>-X</b> options; in particular, it does not support <b>-X32</b> which is
      the default for AIX <b>ar</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>--plugin</b> <i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>The optional command-line switch <b>--plugin</b> <i>name</i> causes
      <b>ar</b> to load the plugin called <i>name</i> which adds support for
      more file formats, including object files with link-time optimization
      information.
    <p class="Pp">This option is only available if the toolchain has been built
        with plugin support enabled.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <b>--plugin</b> is not provided, but plugin support has
        been enabled then <b>ar</b> iterates over the files in
        <i>${libdir}/bfd-plugins</i> in alphabetic order and the first plugin
        that claims the object in question is used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Please note that this plugin search directory is <i>not</i>
        the one used by <b>ld</b>'s <b>-plugin</b> option. In order to make
        <b>ar</b> use the linker plugin it must be copied into the
        <i>${libdir}/bfd-plugins</i> directory. For GCC based compilations the
        linker plugin is called <i>liblto_plugin.so.0.0.0</i>. For Clang based
        compilations it is called <i>LLVMgold.so</i>. The GCC plugin is always
        backwards compatible with earlier versions, so it is sufficient to just
        copy the newest one.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>--target</b> <i>target</i></dt>
  <dd>The optional command-line switch <b>--target</b> <i>bfdname</i> specifies
      that the archive members are in an object code format different from your
      system's default format. See</dd>
  <dt><b>--output</b> <i>dirname</i></dt>
  <dd>The <b>--output</b> option can be used to specify a path to a directory
      into which archive members should be extracted. If this option is not
      specified then the current directory will be used.
    <p class="Pp">Note - although the presence of this option does imply a
        <b>x</b> extraction operation that option must still be included on the
        command line.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>@</b><i>file</i></dt>
  <dd>Read command-line options from <i>file</i>. The options read are inserted
      in place of the original @<i>file</i> option. If <i>file</i> does not
      exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and
      not removed.
    <p class="Pp">Options in <i>file</i> are separated by whitespace. A
        whitespace character may be included in an option by surrounding the
        entire option in either single or double quotes. Any character
        (including a backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be
        included with a backslash. The <i>file</i> may itself contain additional
        @<i>file</i> options; any such options will be processed
      recursively.</p>
