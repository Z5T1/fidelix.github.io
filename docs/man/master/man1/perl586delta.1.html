The perl interpreter is now more tolerant of UTF-16-encoded scripts.
<p class="Pp">On Win32, Perl can now use non-IFS compatible LSPs, which allows
    Perl to work in conjunction with firewalls such as McAfee Guardian. For full
    details see the file <i>README.win32</i>, particularly if you're running
    Win95.</p>

  <li>With the <span class="Li">&quot;base&quot;</span> pragma, an intermediate
      class with no fields used to messes up private fields in the base class.
      This has been fixed.</li>
  <li>Cwd upgraded to version 3.01 (as part of the new PathTools
    distribution)</li>

  <li>File::Spec upgraded to version 3.01 (as part of the new PathTools

  <li>Encode upgraded to version 2.08</li>

<span class="Li">&quot;reverse sort ...&quot;</span> is now optimized to sort in
  reverse, avoiding the generation of a temporary intermediate list.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;for (reverse @foo)&quot;</span> now
    iterates in reverse, avoiding the generation of a temporary reversed
  list.</p>

The regexp engine is now more robust when given invalid utf8 input, as is
  sometimes generated by buggy XS modules.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;foreach&quot;</span> on threads::shared
    array used to be able to crash Perl. This bug has now been fixed.</p>
<p class="Pp">A regexp in <span class="Li">&quot;STDOUT&quot;</span>'s
    destructor used to coredump, because the regexp pad was already freed. This
    has been fixed.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;goto &amp;&quot;</span> is now more robust
    - bugs in deep recursion and chained <span class="Li">&quot;goto
    &amp;&quot;</span> have been fixed.</p>
<p class="Pp">Using <span class="Li">&quot;delete&quot;</span> on an array no
    longer leaks memory. A <span class="Li">&quot;pop&quot;</span> of an item
    from a shared array reference no longer causes a leak.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;eval_sv()&quot;</span> failing a taint test
    could corrupt the stack - this has been fixed.</p>
<p class="Pp">On platforms with 64 bit pointers numeric comparison operators
    used to erroneously compare the addresses of references that are overloaded,
    rather than using the overloaded values. This has been fixed.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;read&quot;</span> into a UTF8-encoded
    buffer with an offset off the end of the buffer no longer mis-calculates
    buffer lengths.</p>
<p class="Pp">Although Perl has promised since version 5.8 that
    <span class="Li">&quot;sort()&quot;</span> would be stable, the two cases
    <span class="Li">&quot;sort {$b cmp $a}&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;sort {$b &lt;=&gt; $a}&quot;</span> could produce
    non-stable sorts. This is corrected in perl5.8.6.</p>
<p class="Pp">Localising <span class="Li">$^D</span> no longer generates a
    diagnostic message about valid -D flags.</p>

From now on all applications embedding perl will behave as if perl were compiled
  with -DPERL_USE_SAFE_PUTENV. See &quot;Environment access&quot; in the
  <i>INSTALL</i> file for details.
<p class="Pp">Most <span class="Li">&quot;C&quot;</span> source files now have
    comments at the top explaining their purpose, which should help anyone
    wishing to get an overview of the implementation.</p>

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
  http://bugs.perl.org. There may also be information at http://www.perl.org,
  the Perl Home Page.
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the
    <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug
    down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the
    output of <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team. You can browse and
    search the Perl 5 bugs at http://bugs.perl.org/</p>
