<b>ld</b> combines a number of object and archive files, relocates their data
  and ties up symbol references. Usually the last step in compiling a program is
  to run <b>ld</b>.
<p class="Pp"><b>ld</b> accepts Linker Command Language files written in a
    superset of AT&amp;T's Link Editor Command Language syntax, to provide
    explicit and total control over the linking process.</p>
<p class="Pp">This man page does not describe the command language; see the
    <b>ld</b> entry in <span class="Li">&quot;info&quot;</span> for full details
    on the command language and on other aspects of the GNU linker.</p>
<p class="Pp">This version of <b>ld</b> uses the general purpose BFD libraries
    to operate on object files. This allows <b>ld</b> to read, combine, and
    write object files in many different formats---for example, COFF or
    <span class="Li">&quot;a.out&quot;</span>. Different formats may be linked
    together to produce any available kind of object file.</p>
<p class="Pp">Aside from its flexibility, the GNU linker is more helpful than
    other linkers in providing diagnostic information. Many linkers abandon
    execution immediately upon encountering an error; whenever possible,
    <b>ld</b> continues executing, allowing you to identify other errors (or, in
    some cases, to get an output file in spite of the error).</p>
<p class="Pp">The GNU linker <b>ld</b> is meant to cover a broad range of
    situations, and to be as compatible as possible with other linkers. As a
    result, you have many choices to control its behavior.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="OPTIONS"><a class="permalink" href="#OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></h1>
The linker supports a plethora of command-line options, but in actual practice
  few of them are used in any particular context. For instance, a frequent use
  of <b>ld</b> is to link standard Unix object files on a standard, supported
  Unix system. On such a system, to link a file
  <span class="Li">&quot;hello.o&quot;</span>:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        ld -o &lt;output&gt; /lib/crt0.o hello.o -lc
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This tells <b>ld</b> to produce a file called <i>output</i> as the
    result of linking the file <span class="Li">&quot;/lib/crt0.o&quot;</span>
    with <span class="Li">&quot;hello.o&quot;</span> and the library
    <span class="Li">&quot;libc.a&quot;</span>, which will come from the
    standard search directories. (See the discussion of the <b>-l</b> option
    below.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Some of the command-line options to <b>ld</b> may be specified at
    any point in the command line. However, options which refer to files, such
    as <b>-l</b> or <b>-T</b>, cause the file to be read at the point at which
    the option appears in the command line, relative to the object files and
    other file options. Repeating non-file options with a different argument
    will either have no further effect, or override prior occurrences (those
    further to the left on the command line) of that option. Options which may
    be meaningfully specified more than once are noted in the descriptions
    below.</p>
<p class="Pp">Non-option arguments are object files or archives which are to be
    linked together. They may follow, precede, or be mixed in with command-line
    options, except that an object file argument may not be placed between an
    option and its argument.</p>
<p class="Pp">Usually the linker is invoked with at least one object file, but
    you can specify other forms of binary input files using <b>-l</b>,
    <b>-R</b>, and the script command language. If <i>no</i> binary input files
    at all are specified, the linker does not produce any output, and issues the
    message <b>No input files</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the linker cannot recognize the format of an object file, it
    will assume that it is a linker script. A script specified in this way
    augments the main linker script used for the link (either the default linker
    script or the one specified by using <b>-T</b>). This feature permits the
    linker to link against a file which appears to be an object or an archive,
    but actually merely defines some symbol values, or uses
    <span class="Li">&quot;INPUT&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;GROUP&quot;</span> to load other objects. Specifying
    a script in this way merely augments the main linker script, with the extra
    commands placed after the main script; use the <b>-T</b> option to replace
    the default linker script entirely, but note the effect of the
    <span class="Li">&quot;INSERT&quot;</span> command.</p>
<p class="Pp">For options whose names are a single letter, option arguments must
    either follow the option letter without intervening whitespace, or be given
    as separate arguments immediately following the option that requires
  them.</p>
<p class="Pp">For options whose names are multiple letters, either one dash or
    two can precede the option name; for example, <b>-trace-symbol</b> and
    <b>--trace-symbol</b> are equivalent. Note---there is one exception to this
    rule. Multiple letter options that start with a lower case 'o' can only be
    preceded by two dashes. This is to reduce confusion with the <b>-o</b>
    option. So for example <b>-omagic</b> sets the output file name to
    <b>magic</b> whereas <b>--omagic</b> sets the NMAGIC flag on the output.</p>
<p class="Pp">Arguments to multiple-letter options must either be separated from
    the option name by an equals sign, or be given as separate arguments
    immediately following the option that requires them. For example,
    <b>--trace-symbol foo</b> and <b>--trace-symbol=foo</b> are equivalent.
    Unique abbreviations of the names of multiple-letter options are
  accepted.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note---if the linker is being invoked indirectly, via a compiler
    driver (e.g. <b>gcc</b>) then all the linker command-line options should be
    prefixed by <b>-Wl,</b> (or whatever is appropriate for the particular
    compiler driver) like this:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
          gcc -Wl,--start-group foo.o bar.o -Wl,--end-group
</pre>
<p class="Pp">This is important, because otherwise the compiler driver program
    may silently drop the linker options, resulting in a bad link. Confusion may
    also arise when passing options that require values through a driver, as the
    use of a space between option and argument acts as a separator, and causes
    the driver to pass only the option to the linker and the argument to the
    compiler. In this case, it is simplest to use the joined forms of both
    single- and multiple-letter options, such as:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
          gcc foo.o bar.o -Wl,-eENTRY -Wl,-Map=a.map
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Here is a table of the generic command-line switches accepted by
    the GNU linker:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>@</b><i>file</i></dt>
  <dd>Read command-line options from <i>file</i>. The options read are inserted
      in place of the original @<i>file</i> option. If <i>file</i> does not
      exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated literally, and
      not removed.
    <p class="Pp">Options in <i>file</i> are separated by whitespace. A
        whitespace character may be included in an option by surrounding the
        entire option in either single or double quotes. Any character
        (including a backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be
        included with a backslash. The <i>file</i> may itself contain additional
        @<i>file</i> options; any such options will be processed
      recursively.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-a</b> <i>keyword</i></dt>
  <dd>This option is supported for HP/UX compatibility. The <i>keyword</i>
      argument must be one of the strings <b>archive</b>, <b>shared</b>, or
      <b>default</b>. <b>-aarchive</b> is functionally equivalent to
      <b>-Bstatic</b>, and the other two keywords are functionally equivalent to
      <b>-Bdynamic</b>. This option may be used any number of times.</dd>
  <dt><b>--audit</b> <i>AUDITLIB</i></dt>
  <dd>Adds <i>AUDITLIB</i> to the <span class="Li">&quot;DT_AUDIT&quot;</span>
      entry of the dynamic section. <i>AUDITLIB</i> is not checked for
      existence, nor will it use the DT_SONAME specified in the library. If
      specified multiple times <span class="Li">&quot;DT_AUDIT&quot;</span> will
      contain a colon separated list of audit interfaces to use. If the linker
      finds an object with an audit entry while searching for shared libraries,
      it will add a corresponding
      <span class="Li">&quot;DT_DEPAUDIT&quot;</span> entry in the output file.
      This option is only meaningful on ELF platforms supporting the rtld-audit
      interface.</dd>
  <dt><b>-b</b> <i>input-format</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--format=</b><i>input-format</i></dt>
  <dd><b>ld</b> may be configured to support more than one kind of object file.
      If your <b>ld</b> is configured this way, you can use the <b>-b</b> option
      to specify the binary format for input object files that follow this
      option on the command line. Even when <b>ld</b> is configured to support
      alternative object formats, you don't usually need to specify this, as
      <b>ld</b> should be configured to expect as a default input format the
      most usual format on each machine. <i>input-format</i> is a text string,
      the name of a particular format supported by the BFD libraries. (You can
      list the available binary formats with <b>objdump -i</b>.)
    <p class="Pp">You may want to use this option if you are linking files with
        an unusual binary format. You can also use <b>-b</b> to switch formats
        explicitly (when linking object files of different formats), by
        including <b>-b</b> <i>input-format</i> before each group of object
        files in a particular format.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The default format is taken from the environment variable
        <span class="Li">&quot;GNUTARGET&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can also define the input format from a script, using the
        command <span class="Li">&quot;TARGET&quot;</span>;</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-c</b> <i>MRI-commandfile</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--mri-script=</b><i>MRI-commandfile</i></dt>
  <dd>For compatibility with linkers produced by MRI, <b>ld</b> accepts script
      files written in an alternate, restricted command language, described in
      the MRI Compatible Script Files section of GNU ld documentation. Introduce
      MRI script files with the option <b>-c</b>; use the <b>-T</b> option to
      run linker scripts written in the general-purpose <b>ld</b> scripting
      language. If <i>MRI-cmdfile</i> does not exist, <b>ld</b> looks for it in
      the directories specified by any <b>-L</b> options.</dd>
  <dt><b>-d</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-dc</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-dp</b></dt>
  <dd>These three options are equivalent; multiple forms are supported for
      compatibility with other linkers. They assign space to common symbols even
      if a relocatable output file is specified (with <b>-r</b>). The script
      command <span class="Li">&quot;FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION&quot;</span> has
      the same effect.</dd>
  <dt><b>--depaudit</b> <i>AUDITLIB</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-P</b> <i>AUDITLIB</i></dt>
  <dd>Adds <i>AUDITLIB</i> to the
      <span class="Li">&quot;DT_DEPAUDIT&quot;</span> entry of the dynamic
      section. <i>AUDITLIB</i> is not checked for existence, nor will it use the
      DT_SONAME specified in the library. If specified multiple times
      <span class="Li">&quot;DT_DEPAUDIT&quot;</span> will contain a colon
      separated list of audit interfaces to use. This option is only meaningful
      on ELF platforms supporting the rtld-audit interface. The -P option is
      provided for Solaris compatibility.</dd>
  <dt><b>-e</b> <i>entry</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--entry=</b><i>entry</i></dt>
  <dd>Use <i>entry</i> as the explicit symbol for beginning execution of your
      program, rather than the default entry point. If there is no symbol named
      <i>entry</i>, the linker will try to parse <i>entry</i> as a number, and
      use that as the entry address (the number will be interpreted in base 10;
      you may use a leading <b>0x</b> for base 16, or a leading <b>0</b> for
      base 8).</dd>
  <dt><b>--exclude-libs</b> <i>lib</i><b>,</b><i>lib</i><b>,...</b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a list of archive libraries from which symbols should not be
      automatically exported. The library names may be delimited by commas or
      colons. Specifying <span class="Li">&quot;--exclude-libs ALL&quot;</span>
      excludes symbols in all archive libraries from automatic export. This
      option is available only for the i386 PE targeted port of the linker and
      for ELF targeted ports. For i386 PE, symbols explicitly listed in a .def
      file are still exported, regardless of this option. For ELF targeted
      ports, symbols affected by this option will be treated as hidden.</dd>
  <dt><b>--exclude-modules-for-implib</b>
    <i>module</i><b>,</b><i>module</i><b>,...</b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies a list of object files or archive members, from which symbols
      should not be automatically exported, but which should be copied wholesale
      into the import library being generated during the link. The module names
      may be delimited by commas or colons, and must match exactly the filenames
      used by <b>ld</b> to open the files; for archive members, this is simply
      the member name, but for object files the name listed must include and
      match precisely any path used to specify the input file on the linker's
      command-line. This option is available only for the i386 PE targeted port
      of the linker. Symbols explicitly listed in a .def file are still
      exported, regardless of this option.</dd>
  <dt><b>-E</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--export-dynamic</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--no-export-dynamic</b></dt>
  <dd>When creating a dynamically linked executable, using the <b>-E</b> option
      or the <b>--export-dynamic</b> option causes the linker to add all symbols
      to the dynamic symbol table. The dynamic symbol table is the set of
      symbols which are visible from dynamic objects at run time.
    <p class="Pp">If you do not use either of these options (or use the
        <b>--no-export-dynamic</b> option to restore the default behavior), the
        dynamic symbol table will normally contain only those symbols which are
        referenced by some dynamic object mentioned in the link.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you use <span class="Li">&quot;dlopen&quot;</span> to load
        a dynamic object which needs to refer back to the symbols defined by the
        program, rather than some other dynamic object, then you will probably
        need to use this option when linking the program itself.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can also use the dynamic list to control what symbols
        should be added to the dynamic symbol table if the output format
        supports it. See the description of <b>--dynamic-list</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that this option is specific to ELF targeted ports. PE
        targets support a similar function to export all symbols from a DLL or
        EXE; see the description of <b>--export-all-symbols</b> below.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-EB</b></dt>
  <dd>Link big-endian objects. This affects the default output format.</dd>
  <dt><b>-EL</b></dt>
  <dd>Link little-endian objects. This affects the default output format.</dd>
  <dt><b>-f</b> <i>name</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--auxiliary=</b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_AUXILIARY field to
      the specified name. This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol table of
      the shared object should be used as an auxiliary filter on the symbol
      table of the shared object <i>name</i>.
    <p class="Pp">If you later link a program against this filter object, then,
        when you run the program, the dynamic linker will see the DT_AUXILIARY
        field. If the dynamic linker resolves any symbols from the filter
        object, it will first check whether there is a definition in the shared
        object <i>name</i>. If there is one, it will be used instead of the
        definition in the filter object. The shared object <i>name</i> need not
        exist. Thus the shared object <i>name</i> may be used to provide an
        alternative implementation of certain functions, perhaps for debugging
        or for machine-specific performance.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This option may be specified more than once. The DT_AUXILIARY
        entries will be created in the order in which they appear on the command
        line.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-F</b> <i>name</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--filter=</b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_FILTER field to
      the specified name. This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol table of
      the shared object which is being created should be used as a filter on the
      symbol table of the shared object <i>name</i>.
    <p class="Pp">If you later link a program against this filter object, then,
        when you run the program, the dynamic linker will see the DT_FILTER
        field. The dynamic linker will resolve symbols according to the symbol
        table of the filter object as usual, but it will actually link to the
        definitions found in the shared object <i>name</i>. Thus the filter
        object can be used to select a subset of the symbols provided by the
        object <i>name</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Some older linkers used the <b>-F</b> option throughout a
        compilation toolchain for specifying object-file format for both input
        and output object files. The GNU linker uses other mechanisms for this
        purpose: the <b>-b</b>, <b>--format</b>, <b>--oformat</b> options, the
        <span class="Li">&quot;TARGET&quot;</span> command in linker scripts,
        and the <span class="Li">&quot;GNUTARGET&quot;</span> environment
        variable. The GNU linker will ignore the <b>-F</b> option when not
        creating an ELF shared object.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-fini=</b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>When creating an ELF executable or shared object, call NAME when the
      executable or shared object is unloaded, by setting DT_FINI to the address
      of the function. By default, the linker uses
      <span class="Li">&quot;_fini&quot;</span> as the function to call.</dd>
  <dt><b>-g</b></dt>
  <dd>Ignored. Provided for compatibility with other tools.</dd>
  <dt><b>-G</b> <i>value</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--gpsize=</b><i>value</i></dt>
  <dd>Set the maximum size of objects to be optimized using the GP register to
      <i>size</i>. This is only meaningful for object file formats such as MIPS
      ELF that support putting large and small objects into different sections.
      This is ignored for other object file formats.</dd>
  <dt><b>-h</b> <i>name</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-soname=</b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>When creating an ELF shared object, set the internal DT_SONAME field to
      the specified name. When an executable is linked with a shared object
      which has a DT_SONAME field, then when the executable is run the dynamic
      linker will attempt to load the shared object specified by the DT_SONAME
      field rather than the using the file name given to the linker.</dd>
  <dt><b>-i</b></dt>
  <dd>Perform an incremental link (same as option <b>-r</b>).</dd>
  <dt><b>-init=</b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>When creating an ELF executable or shared object, call NAME when the
      executable or shared object is loaded, by setting DT_INIT to the address
      of the function. By default, the linker uses
      <span class="Li">&quot;_init&quot;</span> as the function to call.</dd>
  <dt><b>-l</b> <i>namespec</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--library=</b><i>namespec</i></dt>
  <dd>Add the archive or object file specified by <i>namespec</i> to the list of
      files to link. This option may be used any number of times. If
      <i>namespec</i> is of the form <i>:</i><i>filename</i><i></i>, <b>ld</b>
      will search the library path for a file called <i>filename</i>, otherwise
      it will search the library path for a file called
      <i>lib</i><i>namespec</i> <i>.a</i>.
    <p class="Pp">On systems which support shared libraries, <b>ld</b> may also
        search for files other than <i>lib</i><i>namespec</i><i>.a</i>.
        Specifically, on ELF and SunOS systems, <b>ld</b> will search a
        directory for a library called <i>lib</i><i>namespec</i><i>.so</i>
        before searching for one called <i>lib</i><i>namespec</i><i>.a</i>. (By
        convention, a <span class="Li">&quot;.so&quot;</span> extension
        indicates a shared library.) Note that this behavior does not apply to
        <i>:</i><i>filename</i><i></i>, which always specifies a file called
        <i>filename</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The linker will search an archive only once, at the location
        where it is specified on the command line. If the archive defines a
        symbol which was undefined in some object which appeared before the
        archive on the command line, the linker will include the appropriate
        file(s) from the archive. However, an undefined symbol in an object
        appearing later on the command line will not cause the linker to search
        the archive again.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See the <b>-(</b> option for a way to force the linker to
        search archives multiple times.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You may list the same archive multiple times on the command
        line.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This type of archive searching is standard for Unix linkers.
        However, if you are using <b>ld</b> on AIX, note that it is different
        from the behaviour of the AIX linker.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-L</b> <i>searchdir</i></dt>

  <dt><b>--library-path=</b><i>searchdir</i></dt>
  <dd>Add path <i>searchdir</i> to the list of paths that <b>ld</b> will search
      for archive libraries and <b>ld</b> control scripts. You may use this
      option any number of times. The directories are searched in the order in

        with <b>-L</b>) depends on which emulation mode <b>ld</b> is using, and
        in some cases also on how it was configured.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The paths can also be specified in a link script with the
        <span class="Li">&quot;SEARCH_DIR&quot;</span> command. Directories
        specified this way are searched at the point in which the linker script
        appears in the command line.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-m</b> <i>emulation</i></dt>
  <dd>Emulate the <i>emulation</i> linker. You can list the available emulations
      with the <b>--verbose</b> or <b>-V</b> options.
    <p class="Pp">If the <b>-m</b> option is not used, the emulation is taken
        from the <span class="Li">&quot;LDEMULATION&quot;</span> environment
        variable, if that is defined.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Otherwise, the default emulation depends upon how the linker
        was configured.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-M</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--print-map</b></dt>
  <dd>Print a link map to the standard output. A link map provides information
      about the link, including the following:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Where object files are mapped into memory.</li>
  <li>How common symbols are allocated.</li>
  <li>All archive members included in the link, with a mention of the symbol
      which caused the archive member to be brought in.</li>
  <li>The values assigned to symbols.
    <p class="Pp">Note - symbols whose values are computed by an expression
        which involves a reference to a previous value of the same symbol may
        not have correct result displayed in the link map. This is because the
        linker discards intermediate results and only retains the final value of
        an expression. Under such circumstances the linker will display the
        final value enclosed by square brackets. Thus for example a linker
        script containing:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
           foo = 1
           foo = foo * 4
           foo = foo + 8
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">will produce the following output in the link map if the
        <b>-M</b> option is used:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
           0x00000001                foo = 0x1
           [0x0000000c]                foo = (foo * 0x4)
           [0x0000000c]                foo = (foo + 0x8)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">See <b>Expressions</b> for more information about expressions
        in linker scripts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>How GNU properties are merged.
    <p class="Pp">When the linker merges input .note.gnu.property sections into
        one output .note.gnu.property section, some properties are removed or
        updated. These actions are reported in the link map. For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        Removed property 0xc0000002 to merge foo.o (0x1) and bar.o (not found)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This indicates that property 0xc0000002 is removed from output
        when merging properties in <i>foo.o</i>, whose property 0xc0000002 value
        is 0x1, and <i>bar.o</i>, which doesn't have property 0xc0000002.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        Updated property 0xc0010001 (0x1) to merge foo.o (0x1) and bar.o (0x1)
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">This indicates that property 0xc0010001 value is updated to
        0x1 in output when merging properties in <i>foo.o</i>, whose 0xc0010001
        property value is 0x1, and <i>bar.o</i>, whose 0xc0010001 property value
        is 0x1.</p>

      specification published by Microsoft.</dd>
  <dt><b>--no-omagic</b></dt>
  <dd>This option negates most of the effects of the <b>-N</b> option. It sets
      the text section to be read-only, and forces the data segment to be
      page-aligned. Note - this option does not enable linking against shared
      libraries. Use <b>-Bdynamic</b> for this.</dd>
  <dt><b>-o</b> <i>output</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--output=</b><i>output</i></dt>
  <dd>Use <i>output</i> as the name for the program produced by <b>ld</b>; if
      this option is not specified, the name <i>a.out</i> is used by default.
      The script command <span class="Li">&quot;OUTPUT&quot;</span> can also
      specify the output file name.</dd>
  <dt><b>-O</b> <i>level</i></dt>
  <dd>If <i>level</i> is a numeric values greater than zero <b>ld</b> optimizes
      the output. This might take significantly longer and therefore probably
      should only be enabled for the final binary. At the moment this option
      only affects ELF shared library generation. Future releases of the linker
      may make more use of this option. Also currently there is no difference in
      the linker's behaviour for different non-zero values of this option. Again
      this may change with future releases.</dd>
  <dt><b>-plugin</b> <i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Involve a plugin in the linking process. The <i>name</i> parameter is the
      absolute filename of the plugin. Usually this parameter is automatically
      added by the complier, when using link time optimization, but users can
      also add their own plugins if they so wish.
    <p class="Pp">Note that the location of the compiler originated plugins is
        different from the place where the <b>ar</b>, <b>nm</b> and
        <b>ranlib</b> programs search for their plugins. In order for those
        commands to make use of a compiler based plugin it must first be copied
        into the <i>${libdir}/bfd-plugins</i> directory. All gcc based linker
        plugins are backward compatible, so it is sufficient to just copy in the
        newest one.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>--push-state</b></dt>
  <dd>The <b>--push-state</b> allows to preserve the current state of the flags
      which govern the input file handling so that they can all be restored with
      one corresponding <b>--pop-state</b> option.
    <p class="Pp">The option which are covered are: <b>-Bdynamic</b>,

    <p class="Pp">One target for this option are specifications for
        <i>pkg-config</i>. When used with the <b>--libs</b> option all possibly
        needed libraries are listed and then possibly linked with all the time.

  <dt><b>-q</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--emit-relocs</b></dt>
  <dd>Leave relocation sections and contents in fully linked executables. Post
      link analysis and optimization tools may need this information in order to
      perform correct modifications of executables. This results in larger
      executables.
    <p class="Pp">This option is currently only supported on ELF platforms.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>--force-dynamic</b></dt>
  <dd>Force the output file to have dynamic sections. This option is specific to
      VxWorks targets.</dd>
  <dt><b>-r</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--relocatable</b></dt>
  <dd>Generate relocatable output---i.e., generate an output file that can in
      turn serve as input to <b>ld</b>. This is often called <i>partial</i>
      <i>linking</i>. As a side effect, in environments that support standard
      Unix magic numbers, this option also sets the output file's magic number
      to <span class="Li">&quot;OMAGIC&quot;</span>. If this option is not
      specified, an absolute file is produced. When linking C++ programs, this
      option <i>will not</i> resolve references to constructors; to do that, use
      <b>-Ur</b>.
    <p class="Pp">When an input file does not have the same format as the output
        file, partial linking is only supported if that input file does not
        contain any relocations. Different output formats can have further
        restrictions; for example some
        <span class="Li">&quot;a.out&quot;</span>-based formats do not support
        partial linking with input files in other formats at all.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This option does the same thing as <b>-i</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-R</b> <i>filename</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--just-symbols=</b><i>filename</i></dt>
  <dd>Read symbol names and their addresses from <i>filename</i>, but do not
      relocate it or include it in the output. This allows your output file to
      refer symbolically to absolute locations of memory defined in other
      programs. You may use this option more than once.
    <p class="Pp">For compatibility with other ELF linkers, if the <b>-R</b>
        option is followed by a directory name, rather than a file name, it is
        treated as the <b>-rpath</b> option.</p>

  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--no-strip-discarded</b></dt>

  <dt><b>-t</b></dt>

  <dt><b>--trace</b></dt>
  <dd>Print the names of the input files as <b>ld</b> processes them. If
      <b>-t</b> is given twice then members within archives are also printed.
      <b>-t</b> output is useful to generate a list of all the object files and
      scripts involved in linking, for example, when packaging files for a
      linker bug report.</dd>
  <dt><b>-T</b> <i>scriptfile</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--script=</b><i>scriptfile</i></dt>
  <dd>Use <i>scriptfile</i> as the linker script. This script replaces
      <b>ld</b>'s default linker script (rather than adding to it), so
      <i>commandfile</i> must specify everything necessary to describe the
      output file. If <i>scriptfile</i> does not exist in the current directory,
      <span class="Li">&quot;ld&quot;</span> looks for it in the directories
      specified by any preceding <b>-L</b> options. Multiple <b>-T</b> options
      accumulate.</dd>
  <dt><b>-dT</b> <i>scriptfile</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--default-script=</b><i>scriptfile</i></dt>
  <dd>Use <i>scriptfile</i> as the default linker script.
    <p class="Pp">This option is similar to the <b>--script</b> option except
        that processing of the script is delayed until after the rest of the
        command line has been processed. This allows options placed after the
        <b>--default-script</b> option on the command line to affect the
        behaviour of the linker script, which can be important when the linker
        command line cannot be directly controlled by the user. (eg because the
        command line is being constructed by another tool, such as
      <b>gcc</b>).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-u</b> <i>symbol</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--undefined=</b><i>symbol</i></dt>
  <dd>Force <i>symbol</i> to be entered in the output file as an undefined
      symbol. Doing this may, for example, trigger linking of additional modules
      from standard libraries. <b>-u</b> may be repeated with different option
      arguments to enter additional undefined symbols. This option is equivalent
      to the <span class="Li">&quot;EXTERN&quot;</span> linker script command.
    <p class="Pp">If this option is being used to force additional modules to be
        pulled into the link, and if it is an error for the symbol to remain
        undefined, then the option <b>--require-defined</b> should be used
        instead.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>--require-defined=</b><i>symbol</i></dt>
  <dd>Require that <i>symbol</i> is defined in the output file. This option is
      the same as option <b>--undefined</b> except that if <i>symbol</i> is not
      defined in the output file then the linker will issue an error and exit.
      The same effect can be achieved in a linker script by using
      <span class="Li">&quot;EXTERN&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;ASSERT&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;DEFINED&quot;</span> together. This option can be
      used multiple times to require additional symbols.</dd>
  <dt><b>-Ur</b></dt>
  <dd>For anything other than C++ programs, this option is equivalent to
      <b>-r</b>: it generates relocatable output---i.e., an output file that can
      in turn serve as input to <b>ld</b>. When linking C++ programs, <b>-Ur</b>
      <i>does</i> resolve references to constructors, unlike <b>-r</b>. It does
      not work to use <b>-Ur</b> on files that were themselves linked with
      <b>-Ur</b>; once the constructor table has been built, it cannot be added
      to. Use <b>-Ur</b> only for the last partial link, and <b>-r</b> for the
      others.</dd>
  <dt><b>--orphan-handling=</b><i>MODE</i></dt>
  <dd>Control how orphan sections are handled. An orphan section is one not
      specifically mentioned in a linker script.

  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&quot;place&quot;</dt>
  <dd>Orphan sections are placed into a suitable output section following the
      strategy described in <b>Orphan Sections</b>. The option <b>--unique</b>
      also affects how sections are placed.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;discard&quot;</dt>
  <dd>All orphan sections are discarded, by placing them in the <b>/DISCARD/</b>
      section.</dd>
  <dt>&quot;warn&quot;</dt>
  <dd>The linker will place the orphan section as for
      <span class="Li">&quot;place&quot;</span> and also issue a warning.</dd>

  <dd>The linker will exit with an error if any orphan section is found.</dd>

      specifically mentioned in a linker script. You may use this option
      multiple times on the command line; It prevents the normal merging of

  <dd>This option affects the treatment of dynamic libraries referred to by

      binary for each library mentioned in a DT_NEEDED tag in an input dynamic

    <p class="Pp">The format of the table is intentionally simple, so that it
        may be easily processed by a script if necessary. The symbols are
        printed out, sorted by name. For each symbol, a list of file names is
        given. If the symbol is defined, the first file listed is the location
        of the definition. If the symbol is defined as a common value then any
        files where this happens appear next. Finally any files that reference
        the symbol are listed.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>--no-define-common</b></dt>
  <dd>This option inhibits the assignment of addresses to common symbols. The

      <span class="Li">&quot;INHIBIT_COMMON_ALLOCATION&quot;</span> has the same
      effect.
    <p class="Pp">The <b>--no-define-common</b> option allows decoupling the
        decision to assign addresses to Common symbols from the choice of the
        output file type; otherwise a non-Relocatable output type forces
        assigning addresses to Common symbols. Using <b>--no-define-common</b>
        allows Common symbols that are referenced from a shared library to be
        assigned addresses only in the main program. This eliminates the unused
        duplicate space in the shared library, and also prevents any possible
        confusion over resolving to the wrong duplicate when there are many
        dynamic modules with specialized search paths for runtime symbol
        resolution.</p>

  <dt><b>--force-group-allocation</b></dt>
  <dd>This option causes the linker to place section group members like normal

      behaviour of a relocatable link (<b>-r</b>). The script command

      may give a hexadecimal constant or the name of an existing symbol, or use
      <span class="Li">&quot;+&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;-&quot;</span> to add or subtract hexadecimal
      constants or symbols. If you need more elaborate expressions, consider

  <dd>These options control whether to demangle symbol names in error messages

      symbol names in a readable fashion: it strips leading underscores if they
      are used by the object file format, and converts C++ mangled symbol names
      into user readable names. Different compilers have different mangling
      styles. The optional demangling style argument can be used to choose an
      appropriate demangling style for your compiler. The linker will demangle

        when using unmodified Unix makefiles on a Microsoft Windows host, since

      <b>--no-gc-sections</b> on the command line. Note that garbage collection
      for COFF and PE format targets is supported, but the implementation is
      currently considered to be experimental.
    <p class="Pp"><b>--gc-sections</b> decides which input sections are used by
        examining symbols and relocations. The section containing the entry
        symbol and all sections containing symbols undefined on the command-line
        will be kept, as will sections containing symbols referenced by dynamic
        objects. Note that when building shared libraries, the linker must
        assume that any visible symbol is referenced. Once this initial set of
        sections has been determined, the linker recursively marks as used any
        section referenced by their relocations. See <b>--entry</b>,

      <i>output-format</i> is a text string, the name of a particular format

  <dd>Add a directory to the runtime library search path. This is used when

    <p class="Pp">The <b>-rpath</b> option is also used when locating shared
        objects which are needed by shared objects explicitly included in the
        link; see the description of the <b>-rpath-link</b> option. Searching
        <b>-rpath</b> in this way is only supported by native linkers and cross
        linkers which have been configured with the <b>--with-sysroot</b>
        option.</p>

        defined.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <b>-rpath</b> option may also be used on SunOS. By

        the <b>-L</b> options it is given. If a <b>-rpath</b> option is used,
        the runtime search path will be formed exclusively using the
        <b>-rpath</b> options, ignoring the <b>-L</b> options. This can be
        useful when using gcc, which adds many <b>-L</b> options which may be on
        NFS mounted file systems.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For compatibility with other ELF linkers, if the <b>-R</b>
        option is followed by a directory name, rather than a file name, it is
        treated as the <b>-rpath</b> option.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-rpath-link=</b><i>dir</i></dt>
  <dd>When using ELF or SunOS, one shared library may require another. This
      happens when an <span class="Li">&quot;ld -shared&quot;</span> link
      includes a shared library as one of the input files.
    <p class="Pp">When the linker encounters such a dependency when doing a
        non-shared, non-relocatable link, it will automatically try to locate
        the required shared library and include it in the link, if it is not
        included explicitly. In such a case, the <b>-rpath-link</b> option
        specifies the first set of directories to search. The <b>-rpath-link</b>
        option may specify a sequence of directory names either by specifying a
        list of names separated by colons, or by appearing multiple times.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The tokens <i></i><i>$ORIGIN</i><i></i> and
        <i></i><i>$LIB</i><i></i> can appear in these search directories. They
        will be replaced by the full path to the directory containing the
        program or shared object in the case of <i></i><i>$ORIGIN</i><i></i> and
        either <b>lib</b> - for 32-bit binaries - or <b>lib64</b> - for 64-bit

    <p class="Pp">The alternative form of these tokens - <i>${ORIGIN}</i> and
        <i>${LIB}</i> can also be used. The token <i></i><i>$PLATFORM</i><i></i>
        is not supported.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This option should be used with caution as it overrides the
        search path that may have been hard compiled into a shared library. In
        such a case it is possible to use unintentionally a different search
        path than the runtime linker would do.</p>

      Specifically, some processors put large-valued constants in a special
      section. A special register (the global pointer) points into the middle of
      this section, so that constants can be loaded efficiently via a
      base-register relative addressing mode. Since the offset in base-register
      relative mode is fixed and relatively small (e.g., 16 bits), this limits
      the maximum size of the constant pool. Thus, in large programs, it is
      often necessary to use multiple global pointer values in order to be able
      to address all possible constants. This option causes a warning to be
      issued whenever this case occurs.</dd>
  <dt><b>--warn-once</b></dt>
  <dd>Only warn once for each undefined symbol, rather than once per module
      which refers to it.</dd>
  <dt><b>--warn-section-align</b></dt>
  <dd>Warn if the address of an output section is changed because of alignment.
      Typically, the alignment will be set by an input section. The address will
      only be changed if it not explicitly specified; that is, if the
      <span class="Li">&quot;SECTIONS&quot;</span> command does not specify a
      start address for the section.</dd>
  <dt><b>--warn-shared-textrel</b></dt>
  <dd>Warn if the linker adds a DT_TEXTREL to a shared object.</dd>
  <dt><b>--warn-alternate-em</b></dt>
  <dd>Warn if an object has alternate ELF machine code.</dd>
  <dt><b>--warn-unresolved-symbols</b></dt>
  <dd>If the linker is going to report an unresolved symbol (see the option
      <b>--unresolved-symbols</b>) it will normally generate an error. This
      option makes it generate a warning instead.</dd>
  <dt><b>--error-unresolved-symbols</b></dt>
  <dd>This restores the linker's default behaviour of generating errors when it
      is reporting unresolved symbols.</dd>
  <dt><b>--whole-archive</b></dt>
  <dd>For each archive mentioned on the command line after the
      <b>--whole-archive</b> option, include every object file in the archive in
      the link, rather than searching the archive for the required object files.
      This is normally used to turn an archive file into a shared library,
      forcing every object to be included in the resulting shared library. This
      option may be used more than once.
    <p class="Pp">Two notes when using this option from gcc: First, gcc doesn't
        know about this option, so you have to use <b>-Wl,-whole-archive</b>.
        Second, don't forget to use <b>-Wl,-no-whole-archive</b> after your list
        of archives, because gcc will add its own list of archives to your link
        and you may not want this flag to affect those as well.</p>

      Any undefined reference to

      <span class="Li">&quot;</span> will be resolved to <i>symbol</i>.
    <p class="Pp">This can be used to provide a wrapper for a system function.
        The wrapper function should be called
        <span class="Li">&quot;__wrap_</span>
        <i>symbol</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span>. If it wishes to call the
        system function, it should call

    <p class="Pp">Here is a trivial example:</p>

    <p class="Pp">If you link other code with this file using <b>--wrap

        will call the function <span class="Li">&quot;__wrap_malloc&quot;</span>
        instead. The call to <span class="Li">&quot;__real_malloc&quot;</span>
        in <span class="Li">&quot;__wrap_malloc&quot;</span> will call the real
        <span class="Li">&quot;malloc&quot;</span> function.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You may wish to provide a
        <span class="Li">&quot;__real_malloc&quot;</span> function as well, so
        that links without the <b>--wrap</b> option will succeed. If you do
        this, you should not put the definition of
        <span class="Li">&quot;__real_malloc&quot;</span> in the same file as
        <span class="Li">&quot;__wrap_malloc&quot;</span>; if you do, the
        assembler may resolve the call before the linker has a chance to wrap it
        to <span class="Li">&quot;malloc&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Only undefined references are replaced by the linker. So,
        translation unit internal references to <i>symbol</i> are not resolved
        to
        <span class="Li">&quot;__wrap_</span><i>symbol</i><span class="Li">&quot;</span>.
        In the next example, the call to <span class="Li">&quot;f&quot;</span>

  <dd>The PE variants of the COFF object format add an extension that permits
      the use of section names longer than eight characters, the normal limit
      for COFF. By default, these names are only allowed in object files, as
      fully-linked executable images do not carry the COFF string table required
      to support the longer names. As a GNU extension, it is possible to allow
      their use in executable images as well, or to (probably pointlessly!)
      disallow it in object files, by using these two options. Executable images
      generated with these long section names are slightly non-standard,
      carrying as they do a string table, and may generate confusing output when
      examined with non-GNU PE-aware tools, such as file viewers and dumpers.
      However, GDB relies on the use of PE long section names to find Dwarf-2
      debug information sections in an executable image at runtime, and so if
      neither option is specified on the command-line, <b>ld</b> will enable
      long section names, overriding the default and technically correct

      resolve that symbol by linking to the match. For example, the undefined

    <p class="Pp">The following remarks pertain to the original implementation
        of the feature and are obsolete nowadays for Cygwin and MinGW
      targets.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note: Use of the 'auto-import' extension will cause the text
        section of the image file to be made writable. This does not conform to
        the PE-COFF format specification published by Microsoft.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note - use of the 'auto-import' extension will also cause read
        only data which would normally be placed into the .rdata section to be
        placed into the .data section instead. This is in order to work around a
        problem with consts that is described here:
        http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2004-09/msg01101.html</p>
    <p class="Pp">Using 'auto-import' generally will 'just work' -- but
        sometimes you may see this message:</p>
    <p class="Pp">&quot;variable '&lt;var&gt;' can't be auto-imported. Please
        read the documentation for ld's
        <span class="Li">&quot;--enable-auto-import&quot;</span> for
        details.&quot;</p>
    <p class="Pp">This message occurs when some (sub)expression accesses an
        address ultimately given by the sum of two constants (Win32 import
        tables only allow one). Instances where this may occur include accesses
        to member fields of struct variables imported from a DLL, as well as
        using a constant index into an array variable imported from a DLL. Any
        multiword variable (arrays, structs, long long, etc) may trigger this
        error condition. However, regardless of the exact data type of the
        offending exported variable, ld will always detect it, issue the
        warning, and exit.</p>
    <p class="Pp">There are several ways to address this difficulty, regardless
        of the data type of the exported variable:</p>
    <p class="Pp">One way is to use --enable-runtime-pseudo-reloc switch. This
        leaves the task of adjusting references in your client code for runtime
        environment, so this method works only when runtime environment supports
        this feature.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A second solution is to force one of the 'constants' to be a
        variable -- that is, unknown and un-optimizable at compile time. For
        arrays, there are two possibilities: a) make the indexee (the array's
        address) a variable, or b) make the 'constant' index a variable.
      Thus:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        extern type extern_array[];
        extern_array[1] --&gt;
           { volatile type *t=extern_array; t[1] }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        extern type extern_array[];
        extern_array[1] --&gt;
           { volatile int t=1; extern_array[t] }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">For structs (and most other multiword data types) the only
        option is to make the struct itself (or the long long, or the ...)
        variable:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        extern struct s extern_struct;
        extern_struct.field --&gt;
           { volatile struct s *t=&amp;extern_struct; t-&gt;field }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">or</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        extern long long extern_ll;
        extern_ll --&gt;
          { volatile long long * local_ll=&amp;extern_ll; *local_ll }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">A third method of dealing with this difficulty is to abandon
        'auto-import' for the offending symbol and mark it with
        <span class="Li">&quot;__declspec(dllimport)&quot;</span>. However, in
        practice that requires using compile-time #defines to indicate whether
        you are building a DLL, building client code that will link to the DLL,
        or merely building/linking to a static library. In making the choice
        between the various methods of resolving the 'direct address with
        constant offset' problem, you should consider typical real-world
      usage:</p>
    <p class="Pp">Original:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        --foo.h
        extern int arr[];
        --foo.c
        #include &quot;foo.h&quot;
        void main(int argc, char **argv){
          printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,arr[1]);
        }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Solution 1:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        --foo.h
        extern int arr[];
        --foo.c
        #include &quot;foo.h&quot;
        void main(int argc, char **argv){
          /* This workaround is for win32 and cygwin; do not &quot;optimize&quot; */
          volatile int *parr = arr;
          printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,parr[1]);
        }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Solution 2:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        --foo.h
        /* Note: auto-export is assumed (no __declspec(dllexport)) */
        #if (defined(_WIN32) || defined(__CYGWIN__)) &amp;&amp; \
          !(defined(FOO_BUILD_DLL) || defined(FOO_STATIC))
        #define FOO_IMPORT __declspec(dllimport)
        #else
        #define FOO_IMPORT
        #endif
        extern FOO_IMPORT int arr[];
        --foo.c
        #include &quot;foo.h&quot;
        void main(int argc, char **argv){
          printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;,arr[1]);
        }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">A fourth way to avoid this problem is to re-code your library
        to use a functional interface rather than a data interface for the
        offending variables (e.g. <b>set_foo()</b> and <b>get_foo()</b> accessor
        functions).</p>

  <dt><b>--dynamicbase</b></dt>
  <dd>The image base address may be relocated using address space layout

  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--no-insert-timestamp</b></dt>
  <dd>Insert a real timestamp into the image. This is the default behaviour as
      it matches legacy code and it means that the image will work with other,
      proprietary tools. The problem with this default is that it will result in
      slightly different images being produced each time the same sources are
      linked. The option <b>--no-insert-timestamp</b> can be used to insert a
      zero value for the timestamp, this ensuring that binaries produced from
      identical sources will compare identically.</dd>

<p class="Pp">The C6X uClinux target uses a binary format called DSBT to support
    shared libraries. Each shared library in the system needs to have a unique
    index; all executables use an index of 0.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>--dsbt-size</b> <i>size</i></dt>
  <dd>This option sets the number of entries in the DSBT of the current
      executable or shared library to <i>size</i>. The default is to create a
      table with 64 entries.</dd>
  <dt><b>--dsbt-index</b> <i>index</i></dt>
  <dd>This option sets the DSBT index of the current executable or shared
      library to <i>index</i>. The default is 0, which is appropriate for
      generating executables. If a shared library is generated with a DSBT index
      of 0, the <span class="Li">&quot;R_C6000_DSBT_INDEX&quot;</span> relocs
      are copied into the output file.

        merging of adjacent exidx entries in frame unwind info.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>--branch-stub</b></dt>
  <dd>This option enables linker branch relaxation by inserting branch stub
      sections when needed to extend the range of branches. This option is
      usually not required since C-SKY supports branch and call instructions
      that can access the full memory range and branch relaxation is normally
      handled by the compiler or assembler.</dd>
  <dt><b>--stub-group-size=</b><i>N</i></dt>
  <dd>This option allows finer control of linker branch stub creation. It sets
      the maximum size of a group of input sections that can be handled by one
      stub section. A negative value of <i>N</i> locates stub sections after
      their branches, while a positive value allows stub sections to appear
      either before or after the branches. Values of <b>1</b> or <b>-1</b>
      indicate that the linker should choose suitable defaults.</dd>

<p class="Pp">The 68HC11 and 68HC12 linkers support specific options to control
    the memory bank switching mapping and trampoline code generation.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>--no-trampoline</b></dt>
  <dd>This option disables the generation of trampoline. By default a trampoline
      is generated for each far function which is called using a
      <span class="Li">&quot;jsr&quot;</span> instruction (this happens when a
      pointer to a far function is taken).</dd>
  <dt><b>--bank-window</b> <i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>This option indicates to the linker the name of the memory region in the
      <b>MEMORY</b> specification that describes the memory bank window. The
      definition of such region is then used by the linker to compute paging and
      addresses within the memory window.</dd>

    generation when linking for 68K targets.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--no-ignore-branch-isa</b></dt>
  <dd>These options control branch relocation checks for invalid ISA mode
      transitions. If <b>--ignore-branch-isa</b> is used, then the linker
      accepts any branch relocations and any ISA mode transition required is
      lost in relocation calculation, except for some cases of

      conditions and are converted to equivalent
      <span class="Li">&quot;JALX&quot;</span> instructions as the associated
      relocation is calculated. By default or if <b>--no-ignore-branch-isa</b>

You can change the behaviour of <b>ld</b> with the environment variables
  <span class="Li">&quot;GNUTARGET&quot;</span>,
  <span class="Li">&quot;LDEMULATION&quot;</span> and
  <span class="Li">&quot;COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE&quot;</span>.
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;GNUTARGET&quot;</span> determines the
    input-file object format if you don't use <b>-b</b> (or its synonym
    <b>--format</b>). Its value should be one of the BFD names for an input
    format. If there is no <span class="Li">&quot;GNUTARGET&quot;</span> in the
    environment, <b>ld</b> uses the natural format of the target. If
    <span class="Li">&quot;GNUTARGET&quot;</span> is set to
    <span class="Li">&quot;default&quot;</span> then BFD attempts to discover
    the input format by examining binary input files; this method often
    succeeds, but there are potential ambiguities, since there is no method of
    ensuring that the magic number used to specify object-file formats is
    unique. However, the configuration procedure for BFD on each system places
    the conventional format for that system first in the search-list, so
    ambiguities are resolved in favor of convention.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;LDEMULATION&quot;</span> determines the
    default emulation if you don't use the <b>-m</b> option. The emulation can
    affect various aspects of linker behaviour, particularly the default linker
    script. You can list the available emulations with the <b>--verbose</b> or
    <b>-V</b> options. If the <b>-m</b> option is not used, and the
    <span class="Li">&quot;LDEMULATION&quot;</span> environment variable is not
    defined, the default emulation depends upon how the linker was
  configured.</p>
<p class="Pp">Normally, the linker will default to demangling symbols. However,
    if <span class="Li">&quot;COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE&quot;</span> is set in the
    environment, then it will default to not demangling symbols. This
    environment variable is used in a similar fashion by the
    <span class="Li">&quot;gcc&quot;</span> linker wrapper program. The default
    may be overridden by the <b>--demangle</b> and <b>--no-demangle</b>
  options.</p>
