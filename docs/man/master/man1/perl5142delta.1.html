perl5142delta - what is new for perl v5.14.2
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document describes differences between the 5.14.1 release and the 5.14.2
  release.
<p class="Pp">If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.14.0, first
    read perl5141delta, which describes differences between 5.14.0 and
  5.14.1.</p>
</section>

  memory error with GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC (CVE-2011-2728).</a></h2>
Calling <span class="Li">&quot;File::Glob::bsd_glob&quot;</span> with the
  unsupported flag GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC would cause an access violation / segfault. A
  Perl program that accepts a flags value from an external source could expose
  itself to denial of service or arbitrary code execution attacks. There are no
  known exploits in the wild. The problem has been corrected by explicitly
  disabling all unsupported flags and setting unused function pointers to null.
  Bug reported by Clement Lecigne.

  <li>In <span class="Li">@INC</span> filters (subroutines returned by
      subroutines in <span class="Li">@INC</span>), <span class="Li">$_</span>
      used to misbehave: If returned from a subroutine, it would not be copied,
      but the variable itself would be returned; and freeing
      <span class="Li">$_</span> (e.g., with <span class="Li">&quot;undef
      *_&quot;</span>) would cause perl to crash. This has been fixed [perl
      #91880].</li>
  <li>Perl 5.10.0 introduced some faulty logic that made &quot;U*&quot; in the
      middle of a pack template equivalent to &quot;U0&quot; if the input string
      was empty. This has been fixed [perl #90160].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;caller&quot;</span> no longer leaks memory when
      called from the DB package if <span class="Li">@DB::args</span> was
      assigned to after the first call to

      [perl #97010].</li>
  <li><span class="Li">&quot;utf8::decode&quot;</span> had a nasty bug that
      would modify copy-on-write scalars' string buffers in place (i.e.,
      skipping the copy). This could result in hashes having two elements with
      the same key [perl #91834].</li>
  <li>Localising a tied variable used to make it read-only if it contained a

  <li>Elements of restricted hashes (see the fields pragma) containing
      copy-on-write values couldn't be deleted, nor could such hashes be cleared
      (<span class="Li">&quot;%hash = ()&quot;</span>).</li>
  <li>Locking a hash element that is a glob copy no longer causes subsequent
      assignment to it to corrupt the glob.</li>
  <li>A panic involving the combination of the regular expression modifiers
      <span class="Li">&quot;/aa&quot;</span> introduced in 5.14.0 and the

  <dd><span class="Li">&quot;PERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT&quot;</span> is broken.
    <p class="Pp">Since perl 5.14.0, building with
        <span class="Li">&quot;-DPERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT&quot;</span> hasn't been
        possible. This means that perl currently doesn't work on any platforms

    <p class="Pp">While <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT&quot;</span>
        now works again on recent development versions of perl, it actually

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
  http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information at
  http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
    program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny
    but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make
    it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
    send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
    subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
    committers, who be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a
    resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix
    the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use
    this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules
    independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
