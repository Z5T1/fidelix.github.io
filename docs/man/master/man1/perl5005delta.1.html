  the new versioning system</a></h1>
Perl is now developed on two tracks: a maintenance track that makes small, safe
  updates to released production versions with emphasis on compatibility; and a
  development track that pursues more aggressive evolution. Maintenance releases
  (which should be considered production quality) have subversion numbers that
  run from <span class="Li">1</span> to <span class="Li">49</span>, and
  development releases (which should be considered &quot;alpha&quot; quality)
  run from <span class="Li">50</span> to <span class="Li">99</span>.
<p class="Pp">Perl 5.005 is the combined product of the new dual-track
    development scheme.</p>

Starting with Perl 5.004_50 there were many deep and far-reaching changes to the
  language internals. If you have dynamically loaded extensions that you built
  under perl 5.003 or 5.004, you can continue to use them with 5.004, but you
  will need to rebuild and reinstall those extensions to use them 5.005. See
  <i>INSTALL</i> for detailed instructions on how to upgrade.

<h2 class="Ss" id="Perl_Source_Compatibility"><a class="permalink" href="#Perl_Source_Compatibility">Perl
  Source Compatibility</a></h2>
When none of the experimental features are enabled, there should be very few
  user-visible Perl source compatibility issues.
<p class="Pp">If threads are enabled, then some caveats apply.
    <span class="Li">@_</span> and <span class="Li">$_</span> become lexical
    variables. The effect of this should be largely transparent to the user, but
    there are some boundary conditions under which user will need to be aware of
    the issues. For example, <span class="Li">&quot;local(@_)&quot;</span>
    results in a &quot;Can't localize lexical variable
    <span class="Li">@_</span> ...&quot; message. This may be enabled in a
    future version.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some new keywords have been introduced. These are generally
    expected to have very little impact on compatibility. See &quot;New
    <span class="Li">&quot;INIT&quot;</span> keyword&quot;, &quot;New
    <span class="Li">&quot;lock&quot;</span> keyword&quot;, and &quot;New
    <span class="Li">&quot;qr//&quot;</span> operator&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Certain barewords are now reserved. Use of these will provoke a
    warning if you have asked for them with the
    <span class="Li">&quot;-w&quot;</span> switch. See
    &quot;<span class="Li">&quot;our&quot;</span> is now a reserved
  word&quot;.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="C_Source_Compatibility"><a class="permalink" href="#C_Source_Compatibility">C
  Source Compatibility</a></h2>
There have been a large number of changes in the internals to support the new
  features in this release.
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Core sources now require ANSI C compiler
    <p class="Pp">An ANSI C compiler is now <b>required</b> to build perl. See
        <i>INSTALL</i>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>All Perl global variables must now be referenced with an explicit prefix
    <p class="Pp">All Perl global variables that are visible for use by
        extensions now have a <span class="Li">&quot;PL_&quot;</span> prefix.
        New extensions should <span class="Li">&quot;not&quot;</span> refer to
        perl globals by their unqualified names. To preserve sanity, we provide
        limited backward compatibility for globals that are being widely used
        like <span class="Li">&quot;sv_undef&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;na&quot;</span> (which should now be written as
        <span class="Li">&quot;PL_sv_undef&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;PL_na&quot;</span> etc.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you find that your XS extension does not compile anymore
        because a perl global is not visible, try adding a
        <span class="Li">&quot;PL_&quot;</span> prefix to the global and
        rebuild.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It is strongly recommended that all functions in the Perl API
        that don't begin with <span class="Li">&quot;perl&quot;</span> be
        referenced with a <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_&quot;</span> prefix. The
        bare function names without the
        <span class="Li">&quot;Perl_&quot;</span> prefix are supported with
        macros, but this support may cease in a future release.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See perlapi.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Enabling threads has source compatibility issues
    <p class="Pp">Perl built with threading enabled requires extensions to use
        the new <span class="Li">&quot;dTHR&quot;</span> macro to initialize the
        handle to access per-thread data. If you see a compiler error that talks
        about the variable <span class="Li">&quot;thr&quot;</span> not being
        declared (when building a module that has XS code), you need to add
        <span class="Li">&quot;dTHR;&quot;</span> at the beginning of the block
        that elicited the error.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The API function
        <span class="Li">&quot;perl_get_sv(&quot;@&quot;,GV_ADD)&quot;</span>
        should be used instead of directly accessing perl globals as
        <span class="Li">&quot;GvSV(errgv)&quot;</span>. The API call is
        backward compatible with existing perls and provides source
        compatibility with threading is enabled.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See &quot;C Source Compatibility&quot; for more
      information.</p>

</ul>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Binary_Compatibility"><a class="permalink" href="#Binary_Compatibility">Binary
  Compatibility</a></h2>
This version is NOT binary compatible with older versions. All extensions will
  need to be recompiled. Further binaries built with threads enabled are
  incompatible with binaries built without. This should largely be transparent
  to the user, as all binary incompatible configurations have their own unique
  architecture name, and extension binaries get installed at unique locations.
  This allows coexistence of several configurations in the same directory
  hierarchy. See <i>INSTALL</i>.

<h2 class="Ss" id="Security_fixes_may_affect_compatibility"><a class="permalink" href="#Security_fixes_may_affect_compatibility">Security
  fixes may affect compatibility</a></h2>
A few taint leaks and taint omissions have been corrected. This may lead to
  &quot;failure&quot; of scripts that used to work with older versions.
  Compiling with -DINCOMPLETE_TAINTS provides a perl with minimal amounts of
  changes to the tainting behavior. But note that the resulting perl will have
  known insecurities.

Perl has a new Social Contract for contributors. See <i>Porting/Contract</i>.
<p class="Pp">The license included in much of the Perl documentation has
    changed. Most of the Perl documentation was previously under the implicit
    GNU General Public License or the Artistic License (at the user's choice).
    Now much of the documentation unambiguously states the terms under which it
    may be distributed. Those terms are in general much less restrictive than
    the GNU GPL. See perl and the individual perl manpages listed therein.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Compiler"><a class="permalink" href="#Compiler">Compiler</a></h2>
WARNING: The Compiler and related tools are considered <b>experimental</b>.
  Features may change without notice, and there are known limitations and bugs.
  Since the compiler is fully external to perl, the default configuration will
  build and install it.
<p class="Pp">The Compiler produces three different types of transformations of
    a perl program. The C backend generates C code that captures perl's state
    just before execution begins. It eliminates the compile-time overheads of
    the regular perl interpreter, but the run-time performance remains
    comparatively the same. The CC backend generates optimized C code equivalent
    to the code path at run-time. The CC backend has greater potential for big
    optimizations, but only a few optimizations are implemented currently. The
    Bytecode backend generates a platform independent bytecode representation of
    the interpreter's state just before execution. Thus, the Bytecode back end
    also eliminates much of the compilation overhead of the interpreter.</p>
<p class="Pp">The compiler comes with several valuable utilities.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;B::Lint&quot;</span> is an experimental
    module to detect and warn about suspicious code, especially the cases that
    the <span class="Li">&quot;-w&quot;</span> switch does not detect.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;B::Deparse&quot;</span> can be used to
    demystify perl code, and understand how perl optimizes certain
  constructs.</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;B::Xref&quot;</span> generates cross
    reference reports of all definition and use of variables, subroutines and
    formats in a program.</p>

Perl's regular expression engine has been seriously overhauled, and many new

<p class="Pp">Here is an itemized summary:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>Many new and improved optimizations</dt>
  <dd>Changes in the RE engine:

        Unneeded nodes removed;
        Substrings merged together;
        New types of nodes to process (SUBEXPR)* and similar expressions

        Backtracking might not restore start of $3.
        No feedback if max count for * or + on &quot;complex&quot; subexpression
            was reached, similarly (but at compile time) for {3,34567}
        Primitive restrictions on max count introduced to decrease a

Perl now contains its own highly optimized <b>qsort()</b> routine. The new

  <span class="Li">&quot;qsort()&quot;</span>s that were being used before used
  to have this problem.) In our testing, the new
  <span class="Li">&quot;qsort()&quot;</span> required the minimal number of

<h2 class="Ss" id="Reliable_signals"><a class="permalink" href="#Reliable_signals">Reliable

Perl's signal handling is susceptible to random crashes, because signals arrive

<p class="Pp">However, one experimental implementation of reliable signals is
    available when threads are enabled. See
    <span class="Li">&quot;Thread::Signal&quot;</span>. Also see <i>INSTALL</i>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Reliable_stack_pointers"><a class="permalink" href="#Reliable_stack_pointers">Reliable
  stack pointers</a></h2>
The internals now reallocate the perl stack only at predictable times. In
  particular, magic calls never trigger reallocations of the stack, because all
  reentrancy of the runtime is handled using a &quot;stack of stacks&quot;. This
  should improve reliability of cached stack pointers in the internals and in
  XSUBs.

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="More_generous_treatment_of_carriage_returns"><a class="permalink" href="#More_generous_treatment_of_carriage_returns">More
  generous treatment of carriage returns</a></h2>
Perl used to complain if it encountered literal carriage returns in scripts. Now
  they are mostly treated like whitespace within program text. Inside string
  literals and here documents, literal carriage returns are ignored if they
  occur paired with linefeeds, or get interpreted as whitespace if they stand
  alone. This behavior means that literal carriage returns in files should be
  avoided. You can get the older, more compatible (but less generous) behavior
  by defining the preprocessor symbol
  <span class="Li">&quot;PERL_STRICT_CR&quot;</span> when building perl. Of
  course, all this has nothing whatever to do with how escapes like
  <span class="Li">&quot;\r&quot;</span> are handled within strings.
<p class="Pp">Note that this doesn't somehow magically allow you to keep all
    text files in DOS format. The generous treatment only applies to files that
    perl itself parses. If your C compiler doesn't allow carriage returns in
    files, you may still be unable to build modules that need a C compiler.</p>

  <span class="Li">&quot;new Foo:: @args&quot;</span>. Note that the method
  <span class="Li">&quot;new()&quot;</span> is called with a first argument of
  <span class="Li">&quot;Foo&quot;</span>, not

It was impossible to test for the existence of a package without actually

  64-bit 'long long' integers has been added. If you add -DUSE_LONG_LONG to your
  ccflags in config.sh (or manually define it in perl.h) then perl will be built
  with 'long long' support. There will be many compiler warnings, and the
  resultant perl may not work on all systems. There are many other issues
  related to third-party extensions and libraries. This option exists to allow
  people to work on those issues.

<h2 class="Ss" id="Magic_lvalues_are_now_more_magical"><a class="permalink" href="#Magic_lvalues_are_now_more_magical">Magic
  lvalues are now more magical</a></h2>
When you say something like <span class="Li">&quot;substr($x, 5) =
  &quot;hi&quot;&quot;</span>, the scalar returned by <b>substr()</b> is
  special, in that any modifications to it affect <span class="Li">$x</span>.
  (This is called a 'magic lvalue' because an 'lvalue' is something on the left
  side of an assignment.) Normally, this is exactly what you would expect to
  happen, but Perl uses the same magic if you use <b>substr()</b>, <b>pos()</b>,
  or <b>vec()</b> in a context where they might be modified, like taking a
  reference with <span class="Li">&quot;\&quot;</span> or as an argument to a
  sub that modifies <span class="Li">@_</span>. In previous versions, this
  'magic' only went one way, but now changes to the scalar the magic refers to
  ($x in the above example) affect the magic lvalue too. For instance, this code
  now acts differently:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
    $x = &quot;hello&quot;;
    sub printit {
        $x = &quot;g'bye&quot;;

  <dt>Ambiguous call resolved as CORE::%s(), qualify as such or use &amp;</dt>
  <dd>(W) A subroutine you have declared has the same name as a Perl keyword,
      and you have used the name without qualification for calling one or the
      other. Perl decided to call the builtin because the subroutine is not
      imported.
    <p class="Pp">To force interpretation as a subroutine call, either put an
        ampersand before the subroutine name, or qualify the name with its
        package. Alternatively, you can import the subroutine (or pretend that
        it's imported with the <span class="Li">&quot;use subs&quot;</span>
        pragma).</p>
    <p class="Pp">To silently interpret it as the Perl operator, use the
        <span class="Li">&quot;CORE::&quot;</span> prefix on the operator (e.g.

  </dd>
  <dt>Bad index while coercing array into hash</dt>

      perlref.</dd>
  <dt>Bareword &quot;%s&quot; refers to nonexistent package</dt>
  <dd>(W) You used a qualified bareword of the form
      <span class="Li">&quot;Foo::&quot;</span>, but the compiler saw no other
      uses of that namespace before that point. Perhaps you need to predeclare a
      package?</dd>
  <dt>Can't call method &quot;%s&quot; on an undefined value</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used the syntax of a method call, but the slot filled by the
      object reference or package name contains an undefined value. Something
      like this will reproduce the error:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

  <dd>(P) For some reason you can't check the filesystem of the script for
      nosuid.</dd>
  <dt>Can't coerce array into hash</dt>
  <dd>(F) You used an array where a hash was expected, but the array has no
      information on how to map from keys to array indices. You can do that only
      with arrays that have a hash reference at index 0.</dd>
  <dt>Can't goto subroutine from an eval-string</dt>
  <dd>(F) The &quot;goto subroutine&quot; call can't be used to jump out of an
      eval &quot;string&quot;. (You can use it to jump out of an eval {BLOCK},
      but you probably don't want to.)</dd>
  <dt>Can't localize pseudo-hash element</dt>
  <dd>(F) You said something like <span class="Li">&quot;local
      $ar-&gt;{'key'}&quot;</span>, where <span class="Li">$ar</span> is a
      reference to a pseudo-hash. That hasn't been implemented yet, but you can
      get a similar effect by localizing the corresponding array element
      directly: <span class="Li">&quot;local
      $ar-&gt;[$ar-&gt;[0]{'key'}]&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Can't use %%! because Errno.pm is not available</dt>
  <dd>(F) The first time the %! hash is used, perl automatically loads the

  <dd>(F) Perl detected tainted data when trying to compile a regular expression
      that contains the <span class="Li">&quot;(?{ ... })&quot;</span>
      zero-width assertion, which is unsafe. See &quot;(?{ code })&quot; in
      perlre, and perlsec.</dd>
  <dt>%s: Eval-group not allowed, use re 'eval'</dt>
  <dd>(F) A regular expression contained the <span class="Li">&quot;(?{ ...
      })&quot;</span> zero-width assertion, but that construct is only allowed
      when the <span class="Li">&quot;use re 'eval'&quot;</span> pragma is in
      effect. See &quot;(?{ code })&quot; in perlre.</dd>
  <dt>%s: Eval-group not allowed at run time</dt>
  <dd>(F) Perl tried to compile a regular expression containing the
      <span class="Li">&quot;(?{ ... })&quot;</span> zero-width assertion at run
      time, as it would when the pattern contains interpolated values. Since
      that is a security risk, it is not allowed. If you insist, you may still
      do this by explicitly building the pattern from an interpolated string at
      run time and using that in an <b>eval()</b>. See &quot;(?{ code })&quot;
      in perlre.</dd>
  <dt>Explicit blessing to '' (assuming package main)</dt>
  <dd>(W) You are blessing a reference to a zero length string. This has the
      effect of blessing the reference into the package main. This is usually
      not what you want. Consider providing a default target package, e.g.
      bless($ref, <span class="Li">$p</span> || 'MyPackage');</dd>
  <dt>Illegal hex digit ignored</dt>
  <dd>(W) You may have tried to use a character other than 0 - 9 or A - F in a
      hexadecimal number. Interpretation of the hexadecimal number stopped
      before the illegal character.</dd>
  <dt>No such array field</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to access an array as a hash, but the field name used is not
      defined. The hash at index 0 should map all valid field names to array
      indices for that to work.</dd>
  <dt>No such field &quot;%s&quot; in variable %s of type %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) You tried to access a field of a typed variable where the type does
      not know about the field name. The field names are looked up in the
      <span class="Li">%FIELDS</span> hash in the type package at compile time.
      The <span class="Li">%FIELDS</span> hash is usually set up with the
      'fields' pragma.</dd>
  <dt>Out of memory during ridiculously large request</dt>
  <dd>(F) You can't allocate more than 2^31+&quot;small amount&quot; bytes. This
      error is most likely to be caused by a typo in the Perl program. e.g.,
      <span class="Li">$arr[time]</span> instead of
      <span class="Li">$arr[$time]</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Range iterator outside integer range</dt>
  <dd>(F) One (or both) of the numeric arguments to the range operator
      &quot;..&quot; are outside the range which can be represented by integers
      internally. One possible workaround is to force Perl to use magical string
      increment by prepending &quot;0&quot; to your numbers.</dd>
  <dt>Recursive inheritance detected while looking for method '%s' %s</dt>
  <dd>(F) More than 100 levels of inheritance were encountered while invoking a
      method. Probably indicates an unintended loop in your inheritance
      hierarchy.</dd>
  <dt>Reference found where even-sized list expected</dt>
  <dd>(W) You gave a single reference where Perl was expecting a list with an
      even number of elements (for assignment to a hash). This usually means
      that you used the anon hash constructor when you meant to use parens. In
      any case, a hash requires key/value <b>pairs</b>.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
    %hash = { one =&gt; 1, two =&gt; 2, };   # WRONG
    %hash = [ qw/ an anon array / ];   # WRONG
    %hash = ( one =&gt; 1, two =&gt; 2, );   # right
    %hash = qw( one 1 two 2 );                 # also fine
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>Undefined value assigned to typeglob</dt>
  <dd>(W) An undefined value was assigned to a typeglob, a la
      <span class="Li">&quot;*foo = undef&quot;</span>. This does nothing. It's
      possible that you really mean <span class="Li">&quot;undef
      *foo&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt>Use of reserved word &quot;%s&quot; is deprecated</dt>
  <dd>(D) The indicated bareword is a reserved word. Future versions of perl may
      use it as a keyword, so you're better off either explicitly quoting the
      word in a manner appropriate for its context of use, or using a different

      either adding a <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&quot;</span> prefix, or using

  <dt>perl: warning: Setting locale failed.</dt>
  <dd>(S) The whole warning message will look something like:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
       perl: warning: Setting locale failed.
       perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings:
               LC_ALL = &quot;En_US&quot;,
               LANG = (unset)
           are supported and installed on your system.
       perl: warning: Falling back to the standard locale (&quot;C&quot;).
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Exactly what were the failed locale settings varies. In the
        above the settings were that the LC_ALL was &quot;En_US&quot; and the
        LANG had no value. This error means that Perl detected that you and/or
        your system administrator have set up the so-called variable system but
        Perl could not use those settings. This was not dead serious,
        fortunately: there is a &quot;default locale&quot; called &quot;C&quot;
        that Perl can and will use, the script will be run. Before you really
        fix the problem, however, you will get the same error message each time
        you run Perl. How to really fix the problem can be found in &quot;LOCALE
        PROBLEMS&quot; in perllocale.</p>

  <dt>regexp too big</dt>
  <dd>(F) The current implementation of regular expressions uses shorts as
      address offsets within a string. Unfortunately this means that if the
      regular expression compiles to longer than 32767, it'll blow up. Usually
      when you want a regular expression this big, there is a better way to do
      it with multiple statements. See perlre.</dd>

You can use &quot;Configure -Uinstallusrbinperl&quot; which causes installperl
  to skip installing perl also as /usr/bin/perl. This is useful if you prefer
  not to modify /usr/bin for some reason or another but harmful because many
  scripts assume to find Perl in /usr/bin/perl.
