<p class="Pp">Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the
    remainder. <b>g++</b> accepts mostly the same options as <b>gcc</b>.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
When you invoke GCC, it normally does preprocessing, compilation, assembly and
  linking. The &quot;overall options&quot; allow you to stop this process at an
  intermediate stage. For example, the <b>-c</b> option says not to run the
  linker. Then the output consists of object files output by the assembler.
<p class="Pp">Other options are passed on to one or more stages of processing.
    Some options control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself. Yet
    other options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
    documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most of the command-line options that you can use with GCC are
    useful for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
    (usually C++), the explanation says so explicitly. If the description for a
    particular option does not mention a source language, you can use that
    option with all supported languages.</p>
<p class="Pp">The usual way to run GCC is to run the executable called
    <b>gcc</b>, or <i>machine</i><b>-gcc</b> when cross-compiling, or
    <i>machine</i><b>-gcc-</b><i>version</i> to run a specific version of GCC.
    When you compile C++ programs, you should invoke GCC as <b>g++</b>
  instead.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>gcc</b> program accepts options and file names as operands.
    Many options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter
    options may <i>not</i> be grouped: <b>-dv</b> is very different from
    <b>-d&#x00A0;-v</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">You can mix options and other arguments. For the most part, the
    order you use doesn't matter. Order does matter when you use several options
    of the same kind; for example, if you specify <b>-L</b> more than once, the
    directories are searched in the order specified. Also, the placement of the
    <b>-l</b> option is significant.</p>
<p class="Pp">Many options have long names starting with <b>-f</b> or with
    <b>-W</b>---for example, <b>-fmove-loop-invariants</b>, <b>-Wformat</b> and
    so on. Most of these have both positive and negative forms; the negative
    form of <b>-ffoo</b> is <b>-fno-foo</b>. This manual documents only one of
    these two forms, whichever one is not the default.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some options take one or more arguments typically separated either
    by a space or by the equals sign (<b>=</b>) from the option name. Unless
    documented otherwise, an argument can be either numeric or a string. Numeric
    arguments must typically be small unsigned decimal or hexadecimal integers.
    Hexadecimal arguments must begin with the <b>0x</b> prefix. Arguments to
    options that specify a size threshold of some sort may be arbitrarily large
    decimal or hexadecimal integers followed by a byte size suffix designating a
    multiple of bytes such as <span class="Li">&quot;kB&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;KiB&quot;</span> for kilobyte and kibibyte,
    respectively, <span class="Li">&quot;MB&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;MiB&quot;</span> for megabyte and mebibyte,
    <span class="Li">&quot;GB&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;GiB&quot;</span> for gigabyte and gigibyte, and so
    on. Such arguments are designated by <i>byte-size</i> in the following text.
    Refer to the NIST, IEC, and other relevant national and international
    standards for the full listing and explanation of the binary and decimal
    byte size prefixes.</p>

  Controlling the Kind of Output</a></h2>
Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation proper,
  assembly and linking, always in that order. GCC is capable of preprocessing
  and compiling several files either into several assembler input files, or into
  one assembler input file; then each assembler input file produces an object
  file, and linking combines all the object files (those newly compiled, and
  those specified as input) into an executable file.
<p class="Pp">For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what
    kind of compilation is done:</p>

  <dd>Specify explicitly the <i>language</i> for the following input files

</dl>
<p class="Pp">If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use
    <b>-x</b> (or filename suffixes) to tell <b>gcc</b> where to start, and one
    of the options <b>-c</b>, <b>-S</b>, or <b>-E</b> to say where <b>gcc</b> is
    to stop. Note that some combinations (for example, <b>-x cpp-output -E</b>)
    instruct <b>gcc</b> to do nothing at all.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd>Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link. The linking stage

    <p class="Pp">If <b>-o</b> is not specified, the default is to put an

  <dd>Like <b>-v</b> except the commands are not executed and arguments are

</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>optimizers</b></dt>
  <dd>Display all of the optimization options supported by the compiler.</dd>
  <dt><b>warnings</b></dt>
  <dd>Display all of the options controlling warning messages produced by the
      compiler.</dd>
  <dt><b>target</b></dt>
  <dd>Display target-specific options. Unlike the <b>--target-help</b> option
      however, target-specific options of the linker and assembler are not

  <dt><b>params</b></dt>
  <dd>Display the values recognized by the <b>--param</b> option.</dd>
  <dt><i>language</i></dt>
  <dd>Display the options supported for <i>language</i>, where <i>language</i>
      is the name of one of the languages supported in this version of GCC.</dd>
  <dt><b>common</b></dt>
  <dd>Display the options that are common to all languages.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">These are the supported qualifiers:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>undocumented</b></dt>
  <dd>Display only those options that are undocumented.</dd>
  <dt><b>joined</b></dt>
  <dd>Display options taking an argument that appears after an equal sign in the
      same continuous piece of text, such as: <b>--help=target</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>separate</b></dt>
  <dd>Display options taking an argument that appears as a separate word
      following the original option, such as: <b>-o output-file</b>.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">Thus for example to display all the undocumented target-specific
    switches supported by the compiler, use:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        --help=target,undocumented
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The sense of a qualifier can be inverted by prefixing it with the
    <b>^</b> character, so for example to display all binary warning options
    (i.e., ones that are either on or off and that do not take an argument) that
    have a description, use:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        --help=warnings,^joined,^undocumented
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The argument to <b>--help=</b> should not consist solely of
    inverted qualifiers.</p>
<p class="Pp">Combining several classes is possible, although this usually
    restricts the output so much that there is nothing to display. One case
    where it does work, however, is when one of the classes is <i>target</i>.
    For example, to display all the target-specific optimization options,
  use:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        --help=target,optimizers
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <b>--help=</b> option can be repeated on the command line.
    Each successive use displays its requested class of options, skipping those
    that have already been displayed. If <b>--help</b> is also specified
    anywhere on the command line then this takes precedence over any
    <b>--help=</b> option.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the <b>-Q</b> option appears on the command line before the
    <b>--help=</b> option, then the descriptive text displayed by <b>--help=</b>
    is changed. Instead of describing the displayed options, an indication is
    given as to whether the option is enabled, disabled or set to a specific
    value (assuming that the compiler knows this at the point where the
    <b>--help=</b> option is used).</p>
<p class="Pp">Here is a truncated example from the ARM port of <b>gcc</b>:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
          % gcc -Q -mabi=2 --help=target -c
          The following options are target specific:
          -mabi=                                2
          -mabort-on-noreturn                   [disabled]
          -mapcs                                [disabled]
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The output is sensitive to the effects of previous command-line
    options, so for example it is possible to find out which optimizations are
    enabled at <b>-O2</b> by using:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        -Q -O2 --help=optimizers
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Alternatively you can discover which binary optimizations are
    enabled by <b>-O3</b> by using:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        gcc -c -Q -O3 --help=optimizers &gt; /tmp/O3-opts
        gcc -c -Q -O2 --help=optimizers &gt; /tmp/O2-opts

  C++ Programs</a></h2>
C++ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes <b>.C</b>, <b>.cc</b>,
  <b>.cpp</b>, <b>.CPP</b>, <b>.c++</b>, <b>.cp</b>, or <b>.cxx</b>; C++ header
  files often use <b>.hh</b>, <b>.hpp</b>, <b>.H</b>, or (for shared template
  code) <b>.tcc</b>; and preprocessed C++ files use the suffix <b>.ii</b>. GCC
  recognizes files with these names and compiles them as C++ programs even if
  you call the compiler the same way as for compiling C programs (usually with
  the name <b>gcc</b>).
<p class="Pp">However, the use of <b>gcc</b> does not add the C++ library.
    <b>g++</b> is a program that calls GCC and automatically specifies linking
    against the C++ library. It treats <b>.c</b>, <b>.h</b> and <b>.i</b> files
    as C++ source files instead of C source files unless <b>-x</b> is used. This
    program is also useful when precompiling a C header file with a <b>.h</b>
    extension for use in C++ compilations. On many systems, <b>g++</b> is also
    installed with the name <b>c++</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When you compile C++ programs, you may specify many of the same
    command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any language; or
    command-line options meaningful for C and related languages; or options that
    are meaningful only for C++ programs.</p>

  Controlling C Dialect</a></h2>
The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived from C,
  such as C++, Objective-C and Objective-C++) that the compiler accepts:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-ansi</b></dt>
  <dd>In C mode, this is equivalent to <b>-std=c90</b>. In C++ mode, it is
      equivalent to <b>-std=c++98</b>.
    <p class="Pp">This turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible
        with ISO C90 (when compiling C code), or of standard C++ (when compiling
        C++ code), such as the <span class="Li">&quot;asm&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;typeof&quot;</span> keywords, and predefined
        macros such as <span class="Li">&quot;unix&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;vax&quot;</span> that identify the type of system
        you are using. It also enables the undesirable and rarely used ISO
        trigraph feature. For the C compiler, it disables recognition of C++
        style <b>//</b> comments as well as the
        <span class="Li">&quot;inline&quot;</span> keyword.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The alternate keywords
        <span class="Li">&quot;__asm__&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;__extension__&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;__inline__&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;__typeof__&quot;</span> continue to work despite
        <b>-ansi</b>. You would not want to use them in an ISO C program, of
        course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be
        included in compilations done with <b>-ansi</b>. Alternate predefined
        macros such as <span class="Li">&quot;__unix__&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;__vax__&quot;</span> are also available, with or
        without <b>-ansi</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <b>-ansi</b> option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
        rejected gratuitously. For that, <b>-Wpedantic</b> is required in
        addition to <b>-ansi</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The macro <span class="Li">&quot;__STRICT_ANSI__&quot;</span>
        is predefined when the <b>-ansi</b> option is used. Some header files
        may notice this macro and refrain from declaring certain functions or
        defining certain macros that the ISO standard doesn't call for; this is
        to avoid interfering with any programs that might use these names for
        other things.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Functions that are normally built in but do not have semantics
        defined by ISO C (such as <span class="Li">&quot;alloca&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;ffs&quot;</span>) are not built-in functions when
        <b>-ansi</b> is used.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-std=</b></dt>
  <dd>Determine the language standard. This option is currently only supported
      when compiling C or C++.
    <p class="Pp">The compiler can accept several base standards, such as
        <b>c90</b> or <b>c++98</b>, and GNU dialects of those standards, such as
        <b>gnu90</b> or <b>gnu++98</b>. When a base standard is specified, the
        compiler accepts all programs following that standard plus those using
        GNU extensions that do not contradict it. For example, <b>-std=c90</b>
        turns off certain features of GCC that are incompatible with ISO C90,
        such as the <span class="Li">&quot;asm&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;typeof&quot;</span> keywords, but not other GNU
        extensions that do not have a meaning in ISO C90, such as omitting the
        middle term of a <span class="Li">&quot;?:&quot;</span> expression. On
        the other hand, when a GNU dialect of a standard is specified, all
        features supported by the compiler are enabled, even when those features
        change the meaning of the base standard. As a result, some
        strict-conforming programs may be rejected. The particular standard is
        used by <b>-Wpedantic</b> to identify which features are GNU extensions
        given that version of the standard. For example <b>-std=gnu90
        -Wpedantic</b> warns about C++ style <b>//</b> comments, while
        <b>-std=gnu99 -Wpedantic</b> does not.</p>

  <dd>Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with

    <p class="Pp">GCC normally generates special code to handle certain built-in
        functions more efficiently; for instance, calls to

        The resulting code is often both smaller and faster, but since the

        those calls, nor can you change the behavior of the functions by linking
        with a different library. In addition, when a function is recognized as
        a built-in function, GCC may use information about that function to warn
        about problems with calls to that function, or to generate more
        efficient code, even if the resulting code still contains calls to that
        function. For example, warnings are given with <b>-Wformat</b> for bad

  Controlling C++ Dialect</a></h2>
This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful for C++
  programs. You can also use most of the GNU compiler options regardless of what
  language your program is in. For example, you might compile a file
  <i>firstClass.C</i> like this:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        g++ -g -fstrict-enums -O -c firstClass.C
</pre>
<p class="Pp">In this example, only <b>-fstrict-enums</b> is an option meant
    only for C++ programs; you can use the other options with any language
    supported by GCC.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some options for compiling C programs, such as <b>-std</b>, are
    also relevant for C++ programs.</p>
<p class="Pp">Here is a list of options that are <i>only</i> for compiling C++
    programs:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-fabi-version=</b><i>n</i></dt>
  <dd>Use version <i>n</i> of the C++ ABI. The default is version 0.
    <p class="Pp">Version 0 refers to the version conforming most closely to the
        C++ ABI specification. Therefore, the ABI obtained using version 0 will
        change in different versions of G++ as ABI bugs are fixed.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Version 1 is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in
        G++ 3.2.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Version 2 is the version of the C++ ABI that first appeared in
        G++ 3.4, and was the default through G++ 4.9.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Version 3 corrects an error in mangling a constant address as
        a template argument.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Version 4, which first appeared in G++ 4.5, implements a
        standard mangling for vector types.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Version 5, which first appeared in G++ 4.6, corrects the
        mangling of attribute const/volatile on function pointer types, decltype
        of a plain decl, and use of a function parameter in the declaration of
        another parameter.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Version 6, which first appeared in G++ 4.7, corrects the
        promotion behavior of C++11 scoped enums and the mangling of template
        argument packs, const/static_cast, prefix ++ and --, and a class scope
        function used as a template argument.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Version 7, which first appeared in G++ 4.8, that treats
        nullptr_t as a builtin type and corrects the mangling of lambdas in
        default argument scope.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Version 8, which first appeared in G++ 4.9, corrects the
        substitution behavior of function types with function-cv-qualifiers.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Version 9, which first appeared in G++ 5.2, corrects the
        alignment of <span class="Li">&quot;nullptr_t&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Version 10, which first appeared in G++ 6.1, adds mangling of
        attributes that affect type identity, such as ia32 calling convention
        attributes (e.g. <b>stdcall</b>).</p>
    <p class="Pp">Version 11, which first appeared in G++ 7, corrects the
        mangling of sizeof... expressions and operator names. For multiple
        entities with the same name within a function, that are declared in
        different scopes, the mangling now changes starting with the twelfth
        occurrence. It also implies <b>-fnew-inheriting-ctors</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Version 12, which first appeared in G++ 8, corrects the
        calling conventions for empty classes on the x86_64 target and for
        classes with only deleted copy/move constructors. It accidentally
        changes the calling convention for classes with a deleted copy
        constructor and a trivial move constructor.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Version 13, which first appeared in G++ 8.2, fixes the
        accidental change in version 12.</p>
    <p class="Pp">See also <b>-Wabi</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-fabi-compat-version=</b><i>n</i></dt>
  <dd>On targets that support strong aliases, G++ works around mangling changes
      by creating an alias with the correct mangled name when defining a symbol
      with an incorrect mangled name. This switch specifies which ABI version to
      use for the alias.
    <p class="Pp">With <b>-fabi-version=0</b> (the default), this defaults to 11
        (GCC 7 compatibility). If another ABI version is explicitly selected,
        this defaults to 0. For compatibility with GCC versions 3.2 through 4.9,
        use <b>-fabi-compat-version=2</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If this option is not provided but <b>-Wabi=</b><i>n</i> is,
        that version is used for compatibility aliases. If this option is
        provided along with <b>-Wabi</b> (without the version), the version from
        this option is used for the warning.</p>
  </dd>

      <span class="Li">&quot;-faligned-new=32&quot;</span> can be used to
      specify how much alignment (in bytes) is provided by that function, but
      few users will need to override the default of
      <span class="Li">&quot;alignof(std::max_align_t)&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">This flag is enabled by default for <b>-std=c++17</b>.</p>

    <p class="Pp">The behavior of this switch is not quite the same as marking

      operation would have been performed even without the

      the compiler is forced to treat the object as if it were an rvalue in
      certain situations such as returning a local variable, where copy elision
      isn't applicable. Consider:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Here, the <span class="Li">&quot;std::move&quot;</span> call
        is redundant. Because G++ implements Core Issue 1579, another example

        }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In this example, copy elision isn't applicable because the
        type of the expression being returned and the function return type
        differ, yet G++ treats the return value as if it were designated by an

      Because these checks scan the method table only at the end of compilation,

<h2 class="Ss" id="Options_to_Control_Diagnostic_Messages_Formatting"><a class="permalink" href="#Options_to_Control_Diagnostic_Messages_Formatting">Options
  to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting</a></h2>
Traditionally, diagnostic messages have been formatted irrespective of the
  output device's aspect (e.g. its width, ...). You can use the options
  described below to control the formatting algorithm for diagnostic messages,
  e.g. how many characters per line, how often source location information
  should be reported. Note that some language front ends may not honor these
  options.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-fmessage-length=</b><i>n</i></dt>
  <dd>Try to format error messages so that they fit on lines of about <i>n</i>
      characters. If <i>n</i> is zero, then no line-wrapping is done; each error
      message appears on a single line. This is the default for all front ends.
    <p class="Pp">Note - this option also affects the display of the
        <b>#error</b> and <b>#warning</b> pre-processor directives, and the
        <b>deprecated</b> function/type/variable attribute. It does not however
        affect the <b>pragma GCC warning</b> and <b>pragma GCC error</b>
        pragmas.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-fdiagnostics-show-location=once</b></dt>
  <dd>Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode. Instructs the diagnostic messages
      reporter to emit source location information <i>once</i>; that is, in case
      the message is too long to fit on a single physical line and has to be
      wrapped, the source location won't be emitted (as prefix) again, over and
      over, in subsequent continuation lines. This is the default behavior.</dd>
  <dt><b>-fdiagnostics-show-location=every-line</b></dt>
  <dd>Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode. Instructs the diagnostic messages
      reporter to emit the same source location information (as prefix) for
      physical lines that result from the process of breaking a message which is
      too long to fit on a single line.</dd>
  <dt><b>-fdiagnostics-color[=</b><i>WHEN</i><b>]</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-fno-diagnostics-color</b></dt>
  <dd>Use color in diagnostics. <i>WHEN</i> is <b>never</b>, <b>always</b>, or
      <b>auto</b>. The default depends on how the compiler has been configured,
      it can be any of the above <i>WHEN</i> options or also <b>never</b> if
      <b>GCC_COLORS</b> environment variable isn't present in the environment,
      and <b>auto</b> otherwise. <b>auto</b> means to use color only when the
      standard error is a terminal. The forms <b>-fdiagnostics-color</b> and
      <b>-fno-diagnostics-color</b> are aliases for
      <b>-fdiagnostics-color=always</b> and <b>-fdiagnostics-color=never</b>,
      respectively.
    <p class="Pp">The colors are defined by the environment variable
        <b>GCC_COLORS</b>. Its value is a colon-separated list of capabilities
        and Select Graphic Rendition (SGR) substrings. SGR commands are
        interpreted by the terminal or terminal emulator. (See the section in
        the documentation of your text terminal for permitted values and their
        meanings as character attributes.) These substring values are integers
        in decimal representation and can be concatenated with semicolons.
        Common values to concatenate include <b>1</b> for bold, <b>4</b> for
        underline, <b>5</b> for blink, <b>7</b> for inverse, <b>39</b> for
        default foreground color, <b>30</b> to <b>37</b> for foreground colors,
        <b>90</b> to <b>97</b> for 16-color mode foreground colors,
        <b>38;5;0</b> to <b>38;5;255</b> for 88-color and 256-color modes
        foreground colors, <b>49</b> for default background color, <b>40</b> to
        <b>47</b> for background colors, <b>100</b> to <b>107</b> for 16-color
        mode background colors, and <b>48;5;0</b> to <b>48;5;255</b> for
        88-color and 256-color modes background colors.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Options_to_Request_or_Suppress_Warnings"><a class="permalink" href="#Options_to_Request_or_Suppress_Warnings">Options
  to Request or Suppress Warnings</a></h2>
Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions that are not
  inherently erroneous but that are risky or suggest there may have been an
  error.
<p class="Pp">The following language-independent options do not enable specific
    warnings but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by GCC.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-fsyntax-only</b></dt>
  <dd>Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond that.</dd>
  <dt><b>-fmax-errors=</b><i>n</i></dt>
  <dd>Limits the maximum number of error messages to <i>n</i>, at which point
      GCC bails out rather than attempting to continue processing the source
      code. If <i>n</i> is 0 (the default), there is no limit on the number of
      error messages produced. If <b>-Wfatal-errors</b> is also specified, then
      <b>-Wfatal-errors</b> takes precedence over this option.</dd>
  <dt><b>-w</b></dt>
  <dd>Inhibit all warning messages.</dd>
  <dt><b>-Werror</b></dt>
  <dd>Make all warnings into errors.</dd>
  <dt><b>-Werror=</b></dt>
  <dd>Make the specified warning into an error. The specifier for a warning is
      appended; for example <b>-Werror=switch</b> turns the warnings controlled
      by <b>-Wswitch</b> into errors. This switch takes a negative form, to be
      used to negate <b>-Werror</b> for specific warnings; for example
      <b>-Wno-error=switch</b> makes <b>-Wswitch</b> warnings not be errors,
      even when <b>-Werror</b> is in effect.
    <p class="Pp">The warning message for each controllable warning includes the
        option that controls the warning. That option can then be used with
        <b>-Werror=</b> and <b>-Wno-error=</b> as described above. (Printing of
        the option in the warning message can be disabled using the
        <b>-fno-diagnostics-show-option</b> flag.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that specifying <b>-Werror=</b><i>foo</i> automatically
        implies <b>-W</b><i>foo</i>. However, <b>-Wno-error=</b><i>foo</i> does
        not imply anything.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-Wfatal-errors</b></dt>
  <dd>This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first error
      occurred rather than trying to keep going and printing further error
      messages.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">You can request many specific warnings with options beginning with
    <b>-W</b>, for example <b>-Wimplicit</b> to request warnings on implicit
    declarations. Each of these specific warning options also has a negative
    form beginning <b>-Wno-</b> to turn off warnings; for example,
    <b>-Wno-implicit</b>. This manual lists only one of the two forms, whichever
    is not the default. For further language-specific options also refer to
    <b>C++ Dialect Options</b> and <b>Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect
    Options</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some options, such as <b>-Wall</b> and <b>-Wextra</b>, turn on
    other options, such as <b>-Wunused</b>, which may turn on further options,
    such as <b>-Wunused-value</b>. The combined effect of positive and negative
    forms is that more specific options have priority over less specific ones,
    independently of their position in the command-line. For options of the same
    specificity, the last one takes effect. Options enabled or disabled via
    pragmas take effect as if they appeared at the end of the command-line.</p>
<p class="Pp">When an unrecognized warning option is requested (e.g.,
    <b>-Wunknown-warning</b>), GCC emits a diagnostic stating that the option is
    not recognized. However, if the <b>-Wno-</b> form is used, the behavior is
    slightly different: no diagnostic is produced for
    <b>-Wno-unknown-warning</b> unless other diagnostics are being produced.
    This allows the use of new <b>-Wno-</b> options with old compilers, but if
    something goes wrong, the compiler warns that an unrecognized option is
    present.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-Wpedantic</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-pedantic</b></dt>
  <dd>Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++; reject all
      programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other programs that do
      not follow ISO C and ISO C++. For ISO C, follows the version of the ISO C
      standard specified by any <b>-std</b> option used.
    <p class="Pp">Valid ISO C and ISO C++ programs should compile properly with
        or without this option (though a rare few require <b>-ansi</b> or a
        <b>-std</b> option specifying the required version of ISO C). However,
        without this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional C and C++
        features are supported as well. With this option, they are rejected.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>-Wpedantic</b> does not cause warning messages for use of
        the alternate keywords whose names begin and end with <b>__</b>.
        Pedantic warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
        <span class="Li">&quot;__extension__&quot;</span>. However, only system
        header files should use these escape routes; application programs should
        avoid them.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Some users try to use <b>-Wpedantic</b> to check programs for
        strict ISO C conformance. They soon find that it does not do quite what
        they want: it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all---only those for
        which ISO C <i>requires</i> a diagnostic, and some others for which
        diagnostics have been added.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A feature to report any failure to conform to ISO C might be
        useful in some instances, but would require considerable additional work
        and would be quite different from <b>-Wpedantic</b>. We don't have plans
        to support such a feature in the near future.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Where the standard specified with <b>-std</b> represents a GNU
        extended dialect of C, such as <b>gnu90</b> or <b>gnu99</b>, there is a
        corresponding <i>base standard</i>, the version of ISO C on which the
        GNU extended dialect is based. Warnings from <b>-Wpedantic</b> are given
        where they are required by the base standard. (It does not make sense
        for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified GNU
        C dialect, since by definition the GNU dialects of C include all
        features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
        nothing to warn about.)</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-pedantic-errors</b></dt>
  <dd>Give an error whenever the <i>base standard</i> (see <b>-Wpedantic</b>)
      requires a diagnostic, in some cases where there is undefined behavior at
      compile-time and in some other cases that do not prevent compilation of
      programs that are valid according to the standard. This is not equivalent
      to <b>-Werror=pedantic</b>, since there are errors enabled by this option
      and not enabled by the latter and vice versa.</dd>
  <dt><b>-Wall</b></dt>
  <dd>This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users consider
      questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to prevent the
      warning), even in conjunction with macros. This also enables some
      language-specific warnings described in <b>C++ Dialect</b> <b>Options</b>
      and <b>Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options</b>.

  <dt><b>-Wformat-overflow=1</b></dt>
  <dd>Level <i>1</i> of <b>-Wformat-overflow</b> enabled by <b>-Wformat</b>
      employs a conservative approach that warns only about calls that most
      likely overflow the buffer. At this level, numeric arguments to format
      directives with unknown values are assumed to have the value of one, and
      strings of unknown length to be empty. Numeric arguments that are known to
      be bounded to a subrange of their type, or string arguments whose output
      is bounded either by their directive's precision or by a finite set of
      string literals, are assumed to take on the value within the range that
      results in the most bytes on output. For example, the call to
      <span class="Li">&quot;sprintf&quot;</span> below is diagnosed because
      even with both <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> equal to zero, the terminating NUL
      character (<span class="Li">'\0'</span>) appended by the function to the
      destination buffer will be written past its end. Increasing the size of
      the buffer by a single byte is sufficient to avoid the warning, though it
      may not be sufficient to avoid the overflow.
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        void f (int a, int b)
        {
          char buf [13];

        }
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-Wformat-overflow=2</b></dt>
  <dd>Level <i>2</i> warns also about calls that might overflow the destination
      buffer given an argument of sufficient length or magnitude. At level
      <i>2</i>, unknown numeric arguments are assumed to have the minimum
      representable value for signed types with a precision greater than 1, and
      the maximum representable value otherwise. Unknown string arguments whose
      length cannot be assumed to be bounded either by the directive's
      precision, or by a finite set of string literals they may evaluate to, or
      the character array they may point to, are assumed to be 1 character long.
    <p class="Pp">At level <i>2</i>, the call in the example above is again
        diagnosed, but this time because with <i>a</i> equal to a 32-bit
        <span class="Li">&quot;INT_MIN&quot;</span> the first
        <span class="Li">%i</span> directive will write some of its digits
        beyond the end of the destination buffer. To make the call safe
        regardless of the values of the two variables, the size of the
        destination buffer must be increased to at least 34 bytes. GCC includes
        the minimum size of the buffer in an informational note following the
        warning.</p>
    <p class="Pp">An alternative to increasing the size of the destination
        buffer is to constrain the range of formatted values. The maximum length
        of string arguments can be bounded by specifying the precision in the
        format directive. When numeric arguments of format directives can be
        assumed to be bounded by less than the precision of their type, choosing
        an appropriate length modifier to the format specifier will reduce the
        required buffer size. For example, if <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> in the
        example above can be assumed to be within the precision of the
        <span class="Li">&quot;short int&quot;</span> type then using either the
        <span class="Li">%hi</span> format directive or casting the argument to
        <span class="Li">&quot;short&quot;</span> reduces the maximum required
        size of the buffer to 24 bytes.</p>

    <p class="Pp">Also warn if a comparison like

    <p class="Pp">Also warn for dangerous uses of the GNU extension to

  </dd>
  <dt><b>-Wsequence-point</b></dt>
  <dd>Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of violations of
      sequence point rules in the C and C++ standards.
    <p class="Pp">The C and C++ standards define the order in which expressions
        in a C/C++ program are evaluated in terms of <i>sequence points</i>,
        which represent a partial ordering between the execution of parts of the
        program: those executed before the sequence point, and those executed
        after it. These occur after the evaluation of a full expression (one
        which is not part of a larger expression), after the evaluation of the
        first operand of a <span class="Li">&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;||&quot;</span>, <span class="Li">&quot;?
        :&quot;</span> or <span class="Li">&quot;,&quot;</span> (comma)
        operator, before a function is called (but after the evaluation of its
        arguments and the expression denoting the called function), and in
        certain other places. Other than as expressed by the sequence point
        rules, the order of evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not
        specified. All these rules describe only a partial order rather than a
        total order, since, for example, if two functions are called within one
        expression with no sequence point between them, the order in which the
        functions are called is not specified. However, the standards committee
        have ruled that function calls do not overlap.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It is not specified when between sequence points modifications
        to the values of objects take effect. Programs whose behavior depends on
        this have undefined behavior; the C and C++ standards specify that
        &quot;Between the previous and next sequence point an object shall have
        its stored value modified at most once by the evaluation of an
        expression. Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine
        the value to be stored.&quot;. If a program breaks these rules, the
        results on any particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Examples of code with undefined behavior are
        <span class="Li">&quot;a = a++;&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;a[n]</span> <span class="Li">=
        b[n++]&quot;</span> and <span class="Li">&quot;a[i++] = i;&quot;</span>.
        Some more complicated cases are not diagnosed by this option, and it may
        give an occasional false positive result, but in general it has been
        found fairly effective at detecting this sort of problem in
      programs.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The C++17 standard will define the order of evaluation of
        operands in more cases: in particular it requires that the right-hand
        side of an assignment be evaluated before the left-hand side, so the
        above examples are no longer undefined. But this warning will still warn
        about them, to help people avoid writing code that is undefined in C and
        earlier revisions of C++.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some
        debate over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle
        cases. Links to discussions of the problem, including proposed formal
        definitions, may be found on the GCC readings page, at

  <dt><b>-Wstringop-truncation</b></dt>
  <dd>Warn for calls to bounded string manipulation functions such as
      <span class="Li">&quot;strncat&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;strncpy&quot;</span>, and
      <span class="Li">&quot;stpncpy&quot;</span> that may either truncate the
      copied string or leave the destination unchanged.
    <p class="Pp">In the following example, the call to
        <span class="Li">&quot;strncat&quot;</span> specifies a bound that is
        less than the length of the source string. As a result, the copy of the
        source will be truncated and so the call is diagnosed. To avoid the
        warning use <span class="Li">&quot;bufsize - strlen (buf) -
        1)&quot;</span> as the bound.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        void append (char *buf, size_t bufsize)
        {
          strncat (buf, &quot;.txt&quot;, 3);
        }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">As another example, the following call to
        <span class="Li">&quot;strncpy&quot;</span> results in copying to
        <span class="Li">&quot;d&quot;</span> just the characters preceding the
        terminating NUL, without appending the NUL to the end. Assuming the
        result of <span class="Li">&quot;strncpy&quot;</span> is necessarily a
        NUL-terminated string is a common mistake, and so the call is diagnosed.
        To avoid the warning when the result is not expected to be
        NUL-terminated, call <span class="Li">&quot;memcpy&quot;</span>
      instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        void copy (char *d, const char *s)
        {
          strncpy (d, s, strlen (s));
        }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In the following example, the call to
        <span class="Li">&quot;strncpy&quot;</span> specifies the size of the
        destination buffer as the bound. If the length of the source string is
        equal to or greater than this size the result of the copy will not be
        NUL-terminated. Therefore, the call is also diagnosed. To avoid the
        warning, specify <span class="Li">&quot;sizeof buf - 1&quot;</span> as
        the bound and set the last element of the buffer to
        <span class="Li">&quot;NUL&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        void copy (const char *s)
        {
          char buf[80];
          strncpy (buf, s, sizeof buf);
          ...
        }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In situations where a character array is intended to store a
        sequence of bytes with no terminating
        <span class="Li">&quot;NUL&quot;</span> such an array may be annotated
        with attribute <span class="Li">&quot;nonstring&quot;</span> to avoid
        this warning. Such arrays, however, are not suitable arguments to
        functions that expect <span class="Li">&quot;NUL&quot;</span>-terminated
        strings. To help detect accidental misuses of such arrays GCC issues
        warnings unless it can prove that the use is safe.</p>

  <dd>This option warns on calls to <span class="Li">&quot;alloca&quot;</span>
      with an integer argument whose value is either zero, or that is not
      bounded by a controlling predicate that limits its value to at most
      <i>byte-size</i>. It also warns for calls to
      <span class="Li">&quot;alloca&quot;</span> where the bound value is
      unknown. Arguments of non-integer types are considered unbounded even if
      they appear to be constrained to the expected range.
    <p class="Pp">For example, a bounded case of
        <span class="Li">&quot;alloca&quot;</span> could be:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        void func (size_t n)

          else
            p = malloc (n);
          f (p);
        }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In the above example, passing
        <span class="Li">&quot;-Walloca-larger-than=1000&quot;</span> would not
        issue a warning because the call to
        <span class="Li">&quot;alloca&quot;</span> is known to be at most 1000
        bytes. However, if
        <span class="Li">&quot;-Walloca-larger-than=500&quot;</span> were
        passed, the compiler would emit a warning.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Unbounded uses, on the other hand, are uses of
        <span class="Li">&quot;alloca&quot;</span> with no controlling predicate
        constraining its integer argument. For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        void func ()
        {
          void *p = alloca (n);

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If
        <span class="Li">&quot;-Walloca-larger-than=500&quot;</span> were
        passed, the above would trigger a warning, but this time because of the
        lack of bounds checking.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note, that even seemingly correct code involving signed
        integers could cause a warning:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        void func (signed int n)
        {
          if (n &lt; 500)

              f (p);
            }
        }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">In the above example, <i>n</i> could be negative, causing a
        larger than expected argument to be implicitly cast into the
        <span class="Li">&quot;alloca&quot;</span> call.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This option also warns when

  <dt><b>-Wfloat-equal</b></dt>
  <dd>Warn if floating-point values are used in equality comparisons.
    <p class="Pp">The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for
        the programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to
        infinitely precise real numbers. If you are doing this, then you need to
        compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
        likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
        when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that's a
        different problem). In particular, instead of testing for equality, you
        should check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and
        this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
        probably mistaken.</p>

<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body. In
      traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals, but in
      ISO C it does not.</li>
  <li>In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist. Traditional
      preprocessors only considered a line to be a directive if the <b>#</b>
      appeared in column 1 on the line. Therefore <b>-Wtraditional</b> warns
      about directives that traditional C understands but ignores because the
      <b>#</b> does not appear as the first character on the line. It also
      suggests you hide directives like
      <span class="Li">&quot;#pragma&quot;</span> not understood by traditional
      C by indenting them. Some traditional implementations do not recognize
      <span class="Li">&quot;#elif&quot;</span>, so this option suggests
      avoiding it altogether.</li>
  <li>A function-like macro that appears without arguments.</li>
  <li>The unary plus operator.</li>
  <li>The <b>U</b> integer constant suffix, or the <b>F</b> or <b>L</b>
      floating-point constant suffixes. (Traditional C does support the <b>L</b>
      suffix on integer constants.) Note, these suffixes appear in macros
      defined in the system headers of most modern systems, e.g. the
      <b>_MIN</b>/<b>_MAX</b> macros in
      <span class="Li">&quot;&lt;limits.h&gt;&quot;</span>. Use of these macros
      in user code might normally lead to spurious warnings, however GCC's
      integrated preprocessor has enough context to avoid warning in these
      cases.</li>
  <li>A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of
      the block.</li>
  <li>A <span class="Li">&quot;switch&quot;</span> statement has an operand of

  <li>A non-<span class="Li">&quot;static&quot;</span> function declaration
      follows a <span class="Li">&quot;static&quot;</span> one. This construct
      is not accepted by some traditional C compilers.</li>
  <li>The ISO type of an integer constant has a different width or signedness
      from its traditional type. This warning is only issued if the base of the
      constant is ten. I.e. hexadecimal or octal values, which typically
      represent bit patterns, are not warned about.</li>
  <li>Usage of ISO string concatenation is detected.</li>
  <li>Initialization of automatic aggregates.</li>
  <li>Identifier conflicts with labels. Traditional C lacks a separate namespace
      for labels.</li>
  <li>Initialization of unions. If the initializer is zero, the warning is
      omitted. This is done under the assumption that the zero initializer in
      user code appears conditioned on e.g.
      <span class="Li">&quot;__STDC__&quot;</span> to avoid missing initializer
      warnings and relies on default initialization to zero in the traditional C
      case.</li>
  <li>Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating-point values and vice
      versa. The absence of these prototypes when compiling with traditional C
      causes serious problems. This is a subset of the possible conversion
      warnings; for the full set use <b>-Wtraditional-conversion</b>.</li>
  <li>Use of ISO C style function definitions. This warning intentionally is
      <i>not</i> issued for prototype declarations or variadic functions because
      these ISO C features appear in your code when using libiberty's
      traditional C compatibility macros,
      <span class="Li">&quot;PARAMS&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;VPARAMS&quot;</span>. This warning is also bypassed

  <dd>Warn when a local variable shadows another local variable or parameter
      whose type is compatible with that of the shadowing variable. In C++, type
      compatibility here means the type of the shadowing variable can be
      converted to that of the shadowed variable. The creation of this flag (in
      addition to <b>-Wshadow=local</b>) is based on the idea that when a local
      variable shadows another one of incompatible type, it is most likely
      intentional, not a bug or typo, as shown in the following example:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        for (SomeIterator i = SomeObj.begin(); i != SomeObj.end(); ++i)
        {

            ...
          }
          ...
        }
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Since the two variable <span class="Li">&quot;i&quot;</span>
        in the example above have incompatible types, enabling only
        <b>-Wshadow=compatible-local</b> will not emit a warning. Because their
        types are incompatible, if a programmer accidentally uses one in place
        of the other, type checking will catch that and emit an error or
        warning. So not warning (about shadowing) in this case will not lead to
        undetected bugs. Use of this flag instead of <b>-Wshadow=local</b> can
        possibly reduce the number of warnings triggered by intentional
        shadowing.</p>

  <dt><b>-Wnormalized=</b>[<b>none</b>|<b>id</b>|<b>nfc</b>|<b>nfkc</b>]</dt>
  <dd>In ISO C and ISO C++, two identifiers are different if they are different
      sequences of characters. However, sometimes when characters outside the
      basic ASCII character set are used, you can have two different character
      sequences that look the same. To avoid confusion, the ISO 10646 standard
      sets out some <i>normalization rules</i> which when applied ensure that
      two sequences that look the same are turned into the same sequence. GCC
      can warn you if you are using identifiers that have not been normalized;
      this option controls that warning.
    <p class="Pp">There are four levels of warning supported by GCC. The default
        is <b>-Wnormalized=nfc</b>, which warns about any identifier that is not
        in the ISO 10646 &quot;C&quot; normalized form, <i>NFC</i>. NFC is the
        recommended form for most uses. It is equivalent to
      <b>-Wnormalized</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Unfortunately, there are some characters allowed in
        identifiers by ISO C and ISO C++ that, when turned into NFC, are not
        allowed in identifiers. That is, there's no way to use these symbols in
        portable ISO C or C++ and have all your identifiers in NFC.
        <b>-Wnormalized=id</b> suppresses the warning for these characters. It
        is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will correct
        this, which is why this option is not the default.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing
        <b>-Wnormalized=none</b> or <b>-Wno-normalized</b>. You should only do
        this if you are using some other normalization scheme (like
        &quot;D&quot;), because otherwise you can easily create bugs that are
        literally impossible to see.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Some characters in ISO 10646 have distinct meanings but look
        identical in some fonts or display methodologies, especially once
        formatting has been applied. For instance
        <span class="Li">&quot;\u207F&quot;</span>, &quot;SUPERSCRIPT LATIN
        SMALL LETTER N&quot;, displays just like a regular
        <span class="Li">&quot;n&quot;</span> that has been placed in a
        superscript. ISO 10646 defines the <i>NFKC</i> normalization scheme to
        convert all these into a standard form as well, and GCC warns if your
        code is not in NFKC if you use <b>-Wnormalized=nfkc</b>. This warning is
        comparable to warning about every identifier that contains the letter O
        because it might be confused with the digit 0, and so is not the
        default, but may be useful as a local coding convention if the
        programming environment cannot be fixed to display these characters
        distinctly.</p>

  for Debugging Your Program</a></h2>
To tell GCC to emit extra information for use by a debugger, in almost all cases
  you need only to add <b>-g</b> to your other options.
<p class="Pp">GCC allows you to use <b>-g</b> with <b>-O</b>. The shortcuts
    taken by optimized code may occasionally be surprising: some variables you
    declared may not exist at all; flow of control may briefly move where you
    did not expect it; some statements may not be executed because they compute
    constant results or their values are already at hand; some statements may
    execute in different places because they have been moved out of loops.
    Nevertheless it is possible to debug optimized output. This makes it
    reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you are not using some other optimization option, consider
    using <b>-Og</b> with <b>-g</b>. With no <b>-O</b> option at all, some
    compiler passes that collect information useful for debugging do not run at
    all, so that <b>-Og</b> may result in a better debugging experience.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

    <p class="Pp">On most systems that use stabs format, <b>-g</b> enables use
        of extra debugging information that only GDB can use; this extra
        information makes debugging work better in GDB but probably makes other
        debuggers crash or refuse to read the program. If you want to control

    <p class="Pp">The optional first word limits the specification to structs
        that are used directly (<b>dir:</b>) or used indirectly (<b>ind:</b>). A
        struct type is used directly when it is the type of a variable, member.
        Indirect uses arise through pointers to structs. That is, when use of an

    <p class="Pp">The optional second word limits the specification to ordinary
        structs (<b>ord:</b>) or generic structs (<b>gen:</b>). Generic structs
        are a bit complicated to explain. For C++, these are non-explicit
        specializations of template classes, or non-template classes within the

    <p class="Pp">The third word specifies the source files for those structs
        for which the compiler should emit debug information. The values
        <b>none</b> and <b>any</b> have the normal meaning. The value
        <b>base</b> means that the base of name of the file in which the type
        declaration appears must match the base of the name of the main
        compilation file. In practice, this means that when compiling
        <i>foo.c</i>, debug information is generated for types declared in that
        file and <i>foo.h</i>, but not other header files. The value <b>sys</b>
        means those types satisfying <b>base</b> or declared in system or
        compiler headers.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Options_That_Control_Optimization"><a class="permalink" href="#Options_That_Control_Optimization">Options
  That Control Optimization</a></h2>
These options control various sorts of optimizations.
<p class="Pp">Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce
    the cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected results.
    Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a breakpoint
    between statements, you can then assign a new value to any variable or
    change the program counter to any other statement in the function and get
    exactly the results you expect from the source code.</p>
<p class="Pp">Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to
    improve the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time
    and possibly the ability to debug the program.</p>
<p class="Pp">The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has
    of the program. Compiling multiple files at once to a single output file
    mode allows the compiler to use information gained from all of the files
    when compiling each of them.</p>
<p class="Pp">Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag. Only
    optimizations that have a flag are listed in this section.</p>
<p class="Pp">Most optimizations are completely disabled at <b>-O0</b> or if an
    <b>-O</b> level is not set on the command line, even if individual
    optimization flags are specified. Similarly, <b>-Og</b> suppresses many
    optimization passes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Depending on the target and how GCC was configured, a slightly
    different set of optimizations may be enabled at each <b>-O</b> level than
    those listed here. You can invoke GCC with <b>-Q --help=optimizers</b> to
    find out the exact set of optimizations that are enabled at each level.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dt><b>-fno-lifetime-dse</b></dt>
  <dd>In C++ the value of an object is only affected by changes within its
      lifetime: when the constructor begins, the object has an indeterminate
      value, and any changes during the lifetime of the object are dead when the

      of this; if your code relies on the value of the object storage persisting
      beyond the lifetime of the object, you can use this flag to disable this
      optimization. To preserve stores before the constructor starts (e.g.
      because your operator new clears the object storage) but still treat the

      The default behavior can be explicitly selected with

  <dt><b>-fsemantic-interposition</b></dt>
  <dd>Some object formats, like ELF, allow interposing of symbols by the dynamic

  <dt><b>-fipa-cp</b></dt>
  <dd>Perform interprocedural constant propagation. This optimization analyzes

  <dt><b>-ftree-loop-im</b></dt>
  <dd>Perform loop invariant motion on trees. This pass moves only invariants
      that are hard to handle at RTL level (function calls, operations that
      expand to nontrivial sequences of insns). With <b>-funswitch-loops</b> it
      also moves operands of conditions that are invariant out of the loop, so
      that we can use just trivial invariantness analysis in loop unswitching.

  <dd>Parallelize loops, i.e., split their iteration space to run in n threads.
      This is only possible for loops whose iterations are independent and can

      enabled by default at <b>-O2</b> and higher as well as <b>-Os</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-ftree-ter</b></dt>
  <dd>Perform temporary expression replacement during the SSA-&gt;normal phase.
      Single use/single def temporaries are replaced at their use location with
      their defining expression. This results in non-GIMPLE code, but gives the
      expanders much more complex trees to work on resulting in better RTL
      generation. This is enabled by default at <b>-O</b> and higher.</dd>
  <dt><b>-ftree-slsr</b></dt>
  <dd>Perform straight-line strength reduction on trees. This recognizes related

  <dd>Alter the cost model used for vectorization. The <i>model</i> argument
      should be one of <b>unlimited</b>, <b>dynamic</b> or <b>cheap</b>. With
      the <b>unlimited</b> model the vectorized code-path is assumed to be
      profitable while with the <b>dynamic</b> model a runtime check guards the
      vectorized code-path to enable it only for iteration counts that will
      likely execute faster than when executing the original scalar loop. The
      <b>cheap</b> model disables vectorization of loops where doing so would be
      cost prohibitive for example due to required runtime checks for data
      dependence or alignment but otherwise is equal to the <b>dynamic</b>
      model. The default cost model depends on other optimization flags and is
      either <b>dynamic</b> or <b>cheap</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-fsimd-cost-model=</b><i>model</i></dt>
  <dd>Alter the cost model used for vectorization of loops marked with the

  <dt><b>-ftree-vrp</b></dt>
  <dd>Perform Value Range Propagation on trees. This is similar to the constant
      propagation pass, but instead of values, ranges of values are propagated.
      This allows the optimizers to remove unnecessary range checks like array
      bound checks and null pointer checks. This is enabled by default at
      <b>-O2</b> and higher. Null pointer check elimination is only done if
      <b>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks</b> is enabled.</dd>
  <dt><b>-fsplit-paths</b></dt>
  <dd>Split paths leading to loop backedges. This can improve dead code

  <dt><b>-fsplit-ivs-in-unroller</b></dt>
  <dd>Enables expression of values of induction variables in later iterations of

  <dd>Allow the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to
      the language being compiled. For C (and C++), this activates optimizations
      based on the type of expressions. In particular, an object of one type is
      assumed never to reside at the same address as an object of a different
      type, unless the types are almost the same. For example, an
      <span class="Li">&quot;unsigned int&quot;</span> can alias an
      <span class="Li">&quot;int&quot;</span>, but not a
      <span class="Li">&quot;void*&quot;</span> or a

        common. Even with <b>-fstrict-aliasing</b>, type-punning is allowed,
        provided the memory is accessed through the union type. So, the code

  </dd>
  <dt><b>-flto[=</b><i>n</i><b>]</b></dt>
  <dd>This option runs the standard link-time optimizer. When invoked with
      source code, it generates GIMPLE (one of GCC's internal representations)
      and writes it to special ELF sections in the object file. When the object
      files are linked together, all the function bodies are read from these ELF
      sections and instantiated as if they had been part of the same translation
      unit.
    <p class="Pp">To use the link-time optimizer, <b>-flto</b> and optimization
        options should be specified at compile time and during the final link.
        It is recommended that you compile all the files participating in the
        same link with the same options and also specify those options at link
        time. For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        gcc -c -O2 -flto foo.c
        gcc -c -O2 -flto bar.c
        gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.o bar.o
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The first two invocations to GCC save a bytecode
        representation of GIMPLE into special ELF sections inside <i>foo.o</i>
        and <i>bar.o</i>. The final invocation reads the GIMPLE bytecode from
        <i>foo.o</i> and <i>bar.o</i>, merges the two files into a single
        internal image, and compiles the result as usual. Since both
        <i>foo.o</i> and <i>bar.o</i> are merged into a single image, this
        causes all the interprocedural analyses and optimizations in GCC to work
        across the two files as if they were a single one. This means, for
        example, that the inliner is able to inline functions in <i>bar.o</i>
        into functions in <i>foo.o</i> and vice-versa.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Another (simpler) way to enable link-time optimization is:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.c bar.c
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The above generates bytecode for <i>foo.c</i> and
        <i>bar.c</i>, merges them together into a single GIMPLE representation
        and optimizes them as usual to produce <i>myprog</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The important thing to keep in mind is that to enable
        link-time optimizations you need to use the GCC driver to perform the
        link step. GCC automatically performs link-time optimization if any of
        the objects involved were compiled with the <b>-flto</b> command-line
        option. You can always override the automatic decision to do link-time
        optimization by passing <b>-fno-lto</b> to the link command.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To make whole program optimization effective, it is necessary
        to make certain whole program assumptions. The compiler needs to know
        what functions and variables can be accessed by libraries and runtime
        outside of the link-time optimized unit. When supported by the linker,
        the linker plugin (see <b>-fuse-linker-plugin</b>) passes information to
        the compiler about used and externally visible symbols. When the linker
        plugin is not available, <b>-fwhole-program</b> should be used to allow
        the compiler to make these assumptions, which leads to more aggressive
        optimization decisions.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When a file is compiled with <b>-flto</b> without
        <b>-fuse-linker-plugin</b>, the generated object file is larger than a
        regular object file because it contains GIMPLE bytecodes and the usual
        final code (see <b>-ffat-lto-objects</b>. This means that object files
        with LTO information can be linked as normal object files; if
        <b>-fno-lto</b> is passed to the linker, no interprocedural
        optimizations are applied. Note that when <b>-fno-fat-lto-objects</b> is
        enabled the compile stage is faster but you cannot perform a regular,
        non-LTO link on them.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When producing the final binary, GCC only applies link-time
        optimizations to those files that contain bytecode. Therefore, you can
        mix and match object files and libraries with GIMPLE bytecodes and final
        object code. GCC automatically selects which files to optimize in LTO
        mode and which files to link without further processing.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Generally, options specified at link time override those
        specified at compile time, although in some cases GCC attempts to infer
        link-time options from the settings used to compile the input files.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you do not specify an optimization level option <b>-O</b>
        at link time, then GCC uses the highest optimization level used when
        compiling the object files. Note that it is generally ineffective to
        specify an optimization level option only at link time and not at
        compile time, for two reasons. First, compiling without optimization
        suppresses compiler passes that gather information needed for effective
        optimization at link time. Second, some early optimization passes can be
        performed only at compile time and not at link time.</p>
    <p class="Pp">There are some code generation flags preserved by GCC when
        generating bytecodes, as they need to be used during the final link.
        Currently, the following options and their settings are taken from the
        first object file that explicitly specifies them: <b>-fPIC</b>,
        <b>-fpic</b>, <b>-fpie</b>, <b>-fcommon</b>, <b>-fexceptions</b>,
        <b>-fnon-call-exceptions</b>, <b>-fgnu-tm</b> and all the <b>-m</b>
        target flags.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Certain ABI-changing flags are required to match in all
        compilation units, and trying to override this at link time with a
        conflicting value is ignored. This includes options such as
        <b>-freg-struct-return</b> and <b>-fpcc-struct-return</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Other options such as <b>-ffp-contract</b>,
        <b>-fno-strict-overflow</b>, <b>-fwrapv</b>, <b>-fno-trapv</b> or
        <b>-fno-strict-aliasing</b> are passed through to the link stage and
        merged conservatively for conflicting translation units. Specifically
        <b>-fno-strict-overflow</b>, <b>-fwrapv</b> and <b>-fno-trapv</b> take
        precedence; and for example <b>-ffp-contract=off</b> takes precedence
        over <b>-ffp-contract=fast</b>. You can override them at link time.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If LTO encounters objects with C linkage declared with
        incompatible types in separate translation units to be linked together
        (undefined behavior according to ISO C99 6.2.7), a non-fatal diagnostic
        may be issued. The behavior is still undefined at run time. Similar
        diagnostics may be raised for other languages.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Another feature of LTO is that it is possible to apply
        interprocedural optimizations on files written in different
      languages:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        gcc -c -flto foo.c
        g++ -c -flto bar.cc
        gfortran -c -flto baz.f90
        g++ -o myprog -flto -O3 foo.o bar.o baz.o -lgfortran
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">Notice that the final link is done with <b>g++</b> to get the
        C++ runtime libraries and <b>-lgfortran</b> is added to get the Fortran
        runtime libraries. In general, when mixing languages in LTO mode, you
        should use the same link command options as when mixing languages in a
        regular (non-LTO) compilation.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If object files containing GIMPLE bytecode are stored in a
        library archive, say <i>libfoo.a</i>, it is possible to extract and use
        them in an LTO link if you are using a linker with plugin support. To
        create static libraries suitable for LTO, use <b>gcc-ar</b> and
        <b>gcc-ranlib</b> instead of <b>ar</b> and <b>ranlib</b>; to show the
        symbols of object files with GIMPLE bytecode, use <b>gcc-nm</b>. Those
        commands require that <b>ar</b>, <b>ranlib</b> and <b>nm</b> have been
        compiled with plugin support. At link time, use the flag
        <b>-fuse-linker-plugin</b> to ensure that the library participates in
        the LTO optimization process:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        gcc -o myprog -O2 -flto -fuse-linker-plugin a.o b.o -lfoo
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">With the linker plugin enabled, the linker extracts the needed
        GIMPLE files from <i>libfoo.a</i> and passes them on to the running GCC
        to make them part of the aggregated GIMPLE image to be optimized.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you are not using a linker with plugin support and/or do
        not enable the linker plugin, then the objects inside <i>libfoo.a</i>
        are extracted and linked as usual, but they do not participate in the
        LTO optimization process. In order to make a static library suitable for
        both LTO optimization and usual linkage, compile its object files with
        <b>-flto</b> <b>-ffat-lto-objects</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Link-time optimizations do not require the presence of the
        whole program to operate. If the program does not require any symbols to
        be exported, it is possible to combine <b>-flto</b> and
        <b>-fwhole-program</b> to allow the interprocedural optimizers to use
        more aggressive assumptions which may lead to improved optimization
        opportunities. Use of <b>-fwhole-program</b> is not needed when linker
        plugin is active (see <b>-fuse-linker-plugin</b>).</p>
    <p class="Pp">The current implementation of LTO makes no attempt to generate
        bytecode that is portable between different types of hosts. The bytecode
        files are versioned and there is a strict version check, so bytecode
        files generated in one version of GCC do not work with an older or newer
        version of GCC.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Link-time optimization does not work well with generation of
        debugging information on systems other than those using a combination of
        ELF and DWARF.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you specify the optional <i>n</i>, the optimization and
        code generation done at link time is executed in parallel using <i>n</i>
        parallel jobs by utilizing an installed <b>make</b> program. The
        environment variable <b>MAKE</b> may be used to override the program
        used. The default value for <i>n</i> is 1.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can also specify <b>-flto=jobserver</b> to use GNU make's
        job server mode to determine the number of parallel jobs. This is useful
        when the Makefile calling GCC is already executing in parallel. You must
        prepend a <b>+</b> to the command recipe in the parent Makefile for this
        to work. This option likely only works if <b>MAKE</b> is GNU make.</p>
  </dd>

    <p class="Pp">The default is the smaller of RAM/8, RLIMIT_RSS, or a limit

<h2 class="Ss" id="Program_Instrumentation_Options"><a class="permalink" href="#Program_Instrumentation_Options">Program
  Instrumentation Options</a></h2>
GCC supports a number of command-line options that control adding run-time
  instrumentation to the code it normally generates. For example, one purpose of
  instrumentation is collect profiling statistics for use in finding program hot
  spots, code coverage analysis, or profile-guided optimizations. Another class
  of program instrumentation is adding run-time checking to detect programming
  errors like invalid pointer dereferences or out-of-bounds array accesses, as
  well as deliberately hostile attacks such as stack smashing or C++ vtable
  hijacking. There is also a general hook which can be used to implement other
  forms of tracing or function-level instrumentation for debug or program
  analysis purposes.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-p</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-pg</b></dt>
  <dd>Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the analysis
      program <b>prof</b> (for <b>-p</b>) or <b>gprof</b> (for <b>-pg</b>). You
      must use this option when compiling the source files you want data about,
      and you must also use it when linking.
    <p class="Pp">You can use the function attribute
        <span class="Li">&quot;no_instrument_function&quot;</span> to suppress
        profiling of individual functions when compiling with these options.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-fprofile-arcs</b></dt>
  <dd>Add code so that program flow <i>arcs</i> are instrumented. During
      execution the program records how many times each branch and call is
      executed and how many times it is taken or returns. On targets that
      support constructors with priority support, profiling properly handles
      constructors, destructors and C++ constructors (and destructors) of
      classes which are used as a type of a global variable.
    <p class="Pp">When the compiled program exits it saves this data to a file
        called <i></i><i>auxname</i><i>.gcda</i> for each source file. The data
        may be used for profile-directed optimizations
        (<b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>), or for test coverage analysis
        (<b>-ftest-coverage</b>). Each object file's <i>auxname</i> is generated
        from the name of the output file, if explicitly specified and it is not
        the final executable, otherwise it is the basename of the source file.
        In both cases any suffix is removed (e.g. <i>foo.gcda</i> for input file
        <i>dir/foo.c</i>, or <i>dir/foo.gcda</i> for output file specified as
        <b>-o dir/foo.o</b>).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>--coverage</b></dt>
  <dd>This option is used to compile and link code instrumented for coverage
      analysis. The option is a synonym for <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>
      <b>-ftest-coverage</b> (when compiling) and <b>-lgcov</b> (when linking).
      See the documentation for those options for more details.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Compile the source files with <b>-fprofile-arcs</b> plus optimization and
      code generation options. For test coverage analysis, use the additional
      <b>-ftest-coverage</b> option. You do not need to profile every source
      file in a program.</li>
  <li>Compile the source files additionally with <b>-fprofile-abs-path</b> to
      create absolute path names in the <i>.gcno</i> files. This allows
      <b>gcov</b> to find the correct sources in projects where compilations
      occur with different working directories.</li>
  <li>Link your object files with <b>-lgcov</b> or <b>-fprofile-arcs</b> (the
      latter implies the former).</li>
  <li>Run the program on a representative workload to generate the arc profile
      information. This may be repeated any number of times. You can run
      concurrent instances of your program, and provided that the file system
      supports locking, the data files will be correctly updated. Unless a
      strict ISO C dialect option is in effect,
      <span class="Li">&quot;fork&quot;</span> calls are detected and correctly
      handled without double counting.</li>
  <li>For profile-directed optimizations, compile the source files again with
      the same optimization and code generation options plus
      <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b>.</li>
  <li>For test coverage analysis, use <b>gcov</b> to produce human readable
      information from the <i>.gcno</i> and <i>.gcda</i> files. Refer to the
      <b>gcov</b> documentation for further information.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">With <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>, for each function of your program GCC
    creates a program flow graph, then finds a spanning tree for the graph. Only
    arcs that are not on the spanning tree have to be instrumented: the compiler
    adds code to count the number of times that these arcs are executed. When an
    arc is the only exit or only entrance to a block, the instrumentation code
    can be added to the block; otherwise, a new basic block must be created to
    hold the instrumentation code.</p>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-ftest-coverage</b></dt>
  <dd>Produce a notes file that the <b>gcov</b> code-coverage utility can use to

      option above for a description of <i>auxname</i> and instructions on how
      to generate test coverage data. Coverage data matches the source files
      more closely if you do not optimize.</dd>
  <dt><b>-fprofile-abs-path</b></dt>
  <dd>Automatically convert relative source file names to absolute path names in
      the <i>.gcno</i> files. This allows <b>gcov</b> to find the correct
      sources in projects where compilations occur with different working
      directories.</dd>
  <dt><b>-fprofile-dir=</b><i>path</i></dt>
  <dd>Set the directory to search for the profile data files in to <i>path</i>.
      This option affects only the profile data generated by
      <b>-fprofile-generate</b>, <b>-ftest-coverage</b>, <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>
      and used by <b>-fprofile-use</b> and <b>-fbranch-probabilities</b> and its
      related options. Both absolute and relative paths can be used. By default,
      GCC uses the current directory as <i>path</i>, thus the profile data file
      appears in the same directory as the object file. In order to prevent the
      file name clashing, if the object file name is not an absolute path, we
      mangle the absolute path of the <i></i><i>sourcename</i><i>.gcda</i> file
      and use it as the file name of a <i>.gcda</i> file.
    <p class="Pp">When an executable is run in a massive parallel environment,
        it is recommended to save profile to different folders. That can be done

  <dt><b>-fvtv-counts</b></dt>
  <dd>This is a debugging flag. When used in conjunction with

      the compiler to keep track of the total number of virtual calls it
      encounters and the number of verifications it inserts. It also counts the
      number of calls to certain run-time library functions that it inserts and
      logs this information for each compilation unit. The compiler writes this

      named by the environment variable <b>VTV_LOGS_DIR</b> if that is defined
      or the current working directory otherwise. It also counts the size of the

  <dt><b>-finstrument-functions</b></dt>
  <dd>Generate instrumentation calls for entry and exit to functions. Just after
      function entry and just before function exit, the following profiling
      functions are called with the address of the current function and its call
      site. (On some platforms,
      <span class="Li">&quot;__builtin_return_address&quot;</span> does not work
      beyond the current function, so the call site information may not be
      available to the profiling functions otherwise.)
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>

    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The first argument is the address of the start of the current
        function, which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded
        inline in other functions. The profiling calls indicate where,
        conceptually, the inline function is entered and exited. This means that
        addressable versions of such functions must be available. If all your
        uses of a function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional
        expansion of code size. If you use <span class="Li">&quot;extern
        inline&quot;</span> in your C code, an addressable version of such
        functions must be provided. (This is normally the case anyway, but if
        you get lucky and the optimizer always expands the functions inline, you
        might have gotten away without providing static copies.)</p>
    <p class="Pp">A function may be given the attribute
        <span class="Li">&quot;no_instrument_function&quot;</span>, in which
        case this instrumentation is not done. This can be used, for example,
        for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority interrupt
        routines, and any functions from which the profiling functions cannot
        safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling routines
        generate output or allocate memory).</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=</b><i>file</i><b>,</b><i>file</i><b>,...</b></dt>
  <dd>Set the list of functions that are excluded from instrumentation (see the
      description of <b>-finstrument-functions</b>). If the file that contains a
      function definition matches with one of <i>file</i>, then that function is
      not instrumented. The match is done on substrings: if the <i>file</i>
      parameter is a substring of the file name, it is considered to be a match.
    <p class="Pp">For example:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        -finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=/bits/stl,include/sys
    </pre>

        contain <i>/bits/stl</i> or <i>include/sys</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If, for some reason, you want to include letter <b>,</b> in
        one of <i>sym</i>, write <b>,</b>. For example,

  </dd>
  <dt><b>-finstrument-functions-exclude-function-list=</b><i>sym</i><b>,</b><i>sym</i><b>,...</b></dt>
  <dd>This is similar to <b>-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list</b>, but
      this option sets the list of function names to be excluded from
      instrumentation. The function name to be matched is its user-visible name,
      such as <span class="Li">&quot;vector&lt;int&gt; blah(const
      vector&lt;int&gt; &amp;)&quot;</span>, not the internal mangled name
      (e.g., <span class="Li">&quot;_Z4blahRSt6vectorIiSaIiEE&quot;</span>). The
      match is done on substrings: if the <i>sym</i> parameter is a substring of
      the function name, it is considered to be a match. For C99 and C++
      extended identifiers, the function name must be given in UTF-8, not using
      universal character names.</dd>
  <dt><b>-fpatchable-function-entry=</b><i>N</i><b>[,</b><i>M</i><b>]</b></dt>
  <dd>Generate <i>N</i> NOPs right at the beginning of each function, with the

      defaults to <span class="Li">0</span> so the function entry points to the
      address just at the first NOP. The NOP instructions reserve extra space
      which can be used to patch in any desired instrumentation at run time,
      provided that the code segment is writable. The amount of space is
      controllable indirectly via the number of NOPs; the NOP instruction used
      corresponds to the instruction emitted by the internal GCC back-end
      interface <span class="Li">&quot;gen_nop&quot;</span>. This behavior is
      target-specific and may also depend on the architecture variant and/or
      other compilation options.
    <p class="Pp">For run-time identification, the starting addresses of these
        areas, which correspond to their respective function entries minus
        <i>M</i>, are additionally collected in the
        <span class="Li">&quot;__patchable_function_entries&quot;</span> section
        of the resulting binary.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that the value of <span class="Li">&quot;__attribute__

        takes precedence over command-line option
        <b>-fpatchable-function-entry=N,M</b>. This can be used to increase the
        area size or to remove it completely on a single function. If
        <span class="Li">&quot;N=0&quot;</span>, no pad location is
      recorded.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Options_Controlling_the_Preprocessor"><a class="permalink" href="#Options_Controlling_the_Preprocessor">Options
  Controlling the Preprocessor</a></h2>
These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source file
  before actual compilation.
<p class="Pp">If you use the <b>-E</b> option, nothing is done except
    preprocessing. Some of these options make sense only together with <b>-E</b>
    because they cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual
    compilation.</p>
<p class="Pp">In addition to the options listed here, there are a number of
    options to control search paths for include files documented in <b>Directory
    Options</b>. Options to control preprocessor diagnostics are listed in
    <b>Warning Options</b>.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-D</b> <i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Predefine <i>name</i> as a macro, with definition
      <span class="Li">1</span>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-D</b> <i>name</i><b>=</b><i>definition</i></dt>
  <dd>The contents of <i>definition</i> are tokenized and processed as if they
      appeared during translation phase three in a <b>#define</b> directive. In
      particular, the definition is truncated by embedded newline characters.
    <p class="Pp">If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or
        shell-like program you may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to
        protect characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell
        syntax.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command
        line, write its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the
        equals sign (if any). Parentheses are meaningful to most shells, so you
        should quote the option. With <b>sh</b> and <b>csh</b>,
        <b>-D'</b><i>name</i><b>(</b><i>args...</i><b>)=</b><i>definition</i><b>'</b>
        works.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>-D</b> and <b>-U</b> options are processed in the order
        they are given on the command line. All <b>-imacros</b> <i>file</i> and
        <b>-include</b> <i>file</i> options are processed after all <b>-D</b>
        and <b>-U</b> options.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-U</b> <i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Cancel any previous definition of <i>name</i>, either built in or provided
      with a <b>-D</b> option.</dd>
  <dt><b>-include</b> <i>file</i></dt>
  <dd>Process <i>file</i> as if <span class="Li">&quot;#include
      &quot;file&quot;&quot;</span> appeared as the first line of the primary
      source file. However, the first directory searched for <i>file</i> is the
      preprocessor's working directory <i>instead of</i> the directory
      containing the main source file. If not found there, it is searched for in
      the remainder of the <span class="Li">&quot;#include
      &quot;...&quot;&quot;</span> search chain as normal.
    <p class="Pp">If multiple <b>-include</b> options are given, the files are
        included in the order they appear on the command line.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-imacros</b> <i>file</i></dt>
  <dd>Exactly like <b>-include</b>, except that any output produced by scanning
      <i>file</i> is thrown away. Macros it defines remain defined. This allows
      you to acquire all the macros from a header without also processing its
      declarations.
    <p class="Pp">All files specified by <b>-imacros</b> are processed before
        all files specified by <b>-include</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-undef</b></dt>
  <dd>Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros. The standard
      predefined macros remain defined.</dd>
  <dt><b>-pthread</b></dt>
  <dd>Define additional macros required for using the POSIX threads library. You
      should use this option consistently for both compilation and linking. This
      option is supported on GNU/Linux targets, most other Unix derivatives, and
      also on x86 Cygwin and MinGW targets.</dd>
  <dt><b>-M</b></dt>
  <dd>Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule suitable
      for <b>make</b> describing the dependencies of the main source file. The
      preprocessor outputs one <b>make</b> rule containing the object file name
      for that source file, a colon, and the names of all the included files,
      including those coming from <b>-include</b> or <b>-imacros</b>
      command-line options.
    <p class="Pp">Unless specified explicitly (with <b>-MT</b> or <b>-MQ</b>),
        the object file name consists of the name of the source file with any
        suffix replaced with object file suffix and with any leading directory
        parts removed. If there are many included files then the rule is split
        into several lines using <b>\</b>-newline. The rule has no commands.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output,
        such as <b>-dM</b>. To avoid mixing such debug output with the
        dependency rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output
        file with <b>-MF</b>, or use an environment variable like
        <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b>. Debug output is still sent to the regular
        output stream as normal.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Passing <b>-M</b> to the driver implies <b>-E</b>, and
        suppresses warnings with an implicit <b>-w</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-MM</b></dt>
  <dd>Like <b>-M</b> but do not mention header files that are found in system
      header directories, nor header files that are included, directly or
      indirectly, from such a header.
    <p class="Pp">This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double
        quotes in an <b>#include</b> directive does not in itself determine
        whether that header appears in <b>-MM</b> dependency output.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-MF</b> <i>file</i></dt>
  <dd>When used with <b>-M</b> or <b>-MM</b>, specifies a file to write the
      dependencies to. If no <b>-MF</b> switch is given the preprocessor sends
      the rules to the same place it would send preprocessed output.
    <p class="Pp">When used with the driver options <b>-MD</b> or <b>-MMD</b>,
        <b>-MF</b> overrides the default dependency output file.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <i>file</i> is <i>-</i>, then the dependencies are written
        to <i>stdout</i>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-MG</b></dt>
  <dd>In conjunction with an option such as <b>-M</b> requesting dependency
      generation, <b>-MG</b> assumes missing header files are generated files
      and adds them to the dependency list without raising an error. The
      dependency filename is taken directly from the
      <span class="Li">&quot;#include&quot;</span> directive without prepending
      any path. <b>-MG</b> also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing
      header file renders this useless.
    <p class="Pp">This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-MP</b></dt>
  <dd>This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for each dependency other
      than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing. These dummy rules
      work around errors <b>make</b> gives if you remove header files without
      updating the <i>Makefile</i> to match.
    <p class="Pp">This is typical output:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        test.o: test.c test.h
        
        test.h:
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-MT</b> <i>target</i></dt>
  <dd>Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation. By default
      CPP takes the name of the main input file, deletes any directory
      components and any file suffix such as <b>.c</b>, and appends the
      platform's usual object suffix. The result is the target.
    <p class="Pp">An <b>-MT</b> option sets the target to be exactly the string
        you specify. If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a
        single argument to <b>-MT</b>, or use multiple <b>-MT</b> options.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For example, <b>-MT&#x00A0;'$(objpfx)foo.o'</b> might give</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        $(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-MQ</b> <i>target</i></dt>
  <dd>Same as <b>-MT</b>, but it quotes any characters which are special to
      Make. <b>-MQ&#x00A0;'$(objpfx)foo.o'</b> gives
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        $$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were
        given with <b>-MQ</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-MD</b></dt>
  <dd><b>-MD</b> is equivalent to <b>-M -MF</b> <i>file</i>, except that
      <b>-E</b> is not implied. The driver determines <i>file</i> based on
      whether an <b>-o</b> option is given. If it is, the driver uses its
      argument but with a suffix of <i>.d</i>, otherwise it takes the name of
      the input file, removes any directory components and suffix, and applies a
      <i>.d</i> suffix.
    <p class="Pp">If <b>-MD</b> is used in conjunction with <b>-E</b>, any
        <b>-o</b> switch is understood to specify the dependency output file,
        but if used without <b>-E</b>, each <b>-o</b> is understood to specify a
        target object file.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Since <b>-E</b> is not implied, <b>-MD</b> can be used to
        generate a dependency output file as a side effect of the compilation
        process.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-MMD</b></dt>
  <dd>Like <b>-MD</b> except mention only user header files, not system header
      files.</dd>
  <dt><b>-fpreprocessed</b></dt>
  <dd>Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already been
      preprocessed. This suppresses things like macro expansion, trigraph
      conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of most directives.
      The preprocessor still recognizes and removes comments, so that you can
      pass a file preprocessed with <b>-C</b> to the compiler without problems.
      In this mode the integrated preprocessor is little more than a tokenizer
      for the front ends.
    <p class="Pp"><b>-fpreprocessed</b> is implicit if the input file has one of
        the extensions <b>.i</b>, <b>.ii</b> or <b>.mi</b>. These are the
        extensions that GCC uses for preprocessed files created by
        <b>-save-temps</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-fdirectives-only</b></dt>
  <dd>When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand macros.
    <p class="Pp">The option's behavior depends on the <b>-E</b> and
        <b>-fpreprocessed</b> options.</p>
    <p class="Pp">With <b>-E</b>, preprocessing is limited to the handling of
        directives such as <span class="Li">&quot;#define&quot;</span>,
        <span class="Li">&quot;#ifdef&quot;</span>, and
        <span class="Li">&quot;#error&quot;</span>. Other preprocessor
        operations, such as macro expansion and trigraph conversion are not
        performed. In addition, the <b>-dD</b> option is implicitly enabled.</p>
    <p class="Pp">With <b>-fpreprocessed</b>, predefinition of command line and
        most builtin macros is disabled. Macros such as
        <span class="Li">&quot;__LINE__&quot;</span>, which are contextually
        dependent, are handled normally. This enables compilation of files
        previously preprocessed with <span class="Li">&quot;-E
        -fdirectives-only&quot;</span>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">With both <b>-E</b> and <b>-fpreprocessed</b>, the rules for
        <b>-fpreprocessed</b> take precedence. This enables full preprocessing
        of files previously preprocessed with <span class="Li">&quot;-E
        -fdirectives-only&quot;</span>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-fdollars-in-identifiers</b></dt>
  <dd>Accept <b>$</b> in identifiers.</dd>
  <dt><b>-fextended-identifiers</b></dt>
  <dd>Accept universal character names in identifiers. This option is enabled by
      default for C99 (and later C standard versions) and C++.</dd>
  <dt><b>-fno-canonical-system-headers</b></dt>
  <dd>When preprocessing, do not shorten system header paths with
      canonicalization.</dd>
  <dt><b>-ftabstop=</b><i>width</i></dt>
  <dd>Set the distance between tab stops. This helps the preprocessor report
      correct column numbers in warnings or errors, even if tabs appear on the
      line. If the value is less than 1 or greater than 100, the option is
      ignored. The default is 8.</dd>
  <dt><b>-ftrack-macro-expansion</b>[<b>=</b><i>level</i>]</dt>
  <dd>Track locations of tokens across macro expansions. This allows the
      compiler to emit diagnostic about the current macro expansion stack when a
      compilation error occurs in a macro expansion. Using this option makes the
      preprocessor and the compiler consume more memory. The <i>level</i>
      parameter can be used to choose the level of precision of token location
      tracking thus decreasing the memory consumption if necessary. Value
      <b>0</b> of <i>level</i> de-activates this option. Value <b>1</b> tracks
      tokens locations in a degraded mode for the sake of minimal memory
      overhead. In this mode all tokens resulting from the expansion of an
      argument of a function-like macro have the same location. Value <b>2</b>
      tracks tokens locations completely. This value is the most memory hungry.
      When this option is given no argument, the default parameter value is
      <b>2</b>.
    <p class="Pp">Note that
        <span class="Li">&quot;-ftrack-macro-expansion=2&quot;</span> is
        activated by default.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-fmacro-prefix-map=</b><i>old</i><b>=</b><i>new</i></dt>
  <dd>When preprocessing files residing in directory <i></i><i>old</i><i></i>,
      expand the <span class="Li">&quot;__FILE__&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;__BASE_FILE__&quot;</span> macros as if the files
      resided in directory <i></i><i>new</i><i></i> instead. This can be used to
      change an absolute path to a relative path by using <i>.</i> for
      <i>new</i> which can result in more reproducible builds that are location
      independent. This option also affects
      <span class="Li">&quot;__builtin_FILE()&quot;</span> during compilation.
      See also <b>-ffile-prefix-map</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-fexec-charset=</b><i>charset</i></dt>
  <dd>Set the execution character set, used for string and character constants.
      The default is UTF-8. <i>charset</i> can be any encoding supported by the
      system's <span class="Li">&quot;iconv&quot;</span> library routine.</dd>
  <dt><b>-fwide-exec-charset=</b><i>charset</i></dt>
  <dd>Set the wide execution character set, used for wide string and character
      constants. The default is UTF-32 or UTF-16, whichever corresponds to the
      width of <span class="Li">&quot;wchar_t&quot;</span>. As with
      <b>-fexec-charset</b>, <i>charset</i> can be any encoding supported by the
      system's <span class="Li">&quot;iconv&quot;</span> library routine;
      however, you will have problems with encodings that do not fit exactly in
      <span class="Li">&quot;wchar_t&quot;</span>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-finput-charset=</b><i>charset</i></dt>
  <dd>Set the input character set, used for translation from the character set
      of the input file to the source character set used by GCC. If the locale
      does not specify, or GCC cannot get this information from the locale, the
      default is UTF-8. This can be overridden by either the locale or this
      command-line option. Currently the command-line option takes precedence if
      there's a conflict. <i>charset</i> can be any encoding supported by the
      system's <span class="Li">&quot;iconv&quot;</span> library routine.</dd>
  <dt><b>-fpch-deps</b></dt>
  <dd>When using precompiled headers, this flag causes the dependency-output
      flags to also list the files from the precompiled header's dependencies.
      If not specified, only the precompiled header are listed and not the files
      that were used to create it, because those files are not consulted when a
      precompiled header is used.</dd>
  <dt><b>-fpch-preprocess</b></dt>
  <dd>This option allows use of a precompiled header together with <b>-E</b>. It
      inserts a special <span class="Li">&quot;#pragma&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;#pragma GCC pch_preprocess
      &quot;</span><i>filename</i> <span class="Li">&quot;&quot;</span> in the

    <p class="Pp">This option is off by default, because the resulting
        preprocessed output is only really suitable as input to GCC. It is
        switched on by <b>-save-temps</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You should not write this

  <dt><b>-fworking-directory</b></dt>
  <dd>Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that let the
      compiler know the current working directory at the time of preprocessing.
      When this option is enabled, the preprocessor emits, after the initial
      linemarker, a second linemarker with the current working directory
      followed by two slashes. GCC uses this directory, when it's present in the
      preprocessed input, as the directory emitted as the current working
      directory in some debugging information formats. This option is implicitly
      enabled if debugging information is enabled, but this can be inhibited
      with the negated form <b>-fno-working-directory</b>. If the <b>-P</b> flag
      is present in the command line, this option has no effect, since no
      <span class="Li">&quot;#line&quot;</span> directives are emitted

  <dd>Cancel an assertion with the predicate <i>predicate</i> and answer

  <dt><b>-C</b></dt>
  <dd>Do not discard comments. All comments are passed through to the output
      file, except for comments in processed directives, which are deleted along
      with the directive.
    <p class="Pp">You should be prepared for side effects when using <b>-C</b>;
        it causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own
        right. For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a
        directive line have the effect of turning that line into an ordinary
        source line, since the first token on the line is no longer a
      <b>#</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-CC</b></dt>
  <dd>Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion. This is like
      <b>-C</b>, except that comments contained within macros are also passed
      through to the output file where the macro is expanded.
    <p class="Pp">In addition to the side effects of the <b>-C</b> option, the
        <b>-CC</b> option causes all C++-style comments inside a macro to be
        converted to C-style comments. This is to prevent later use of that
        macro from inadvertently commenting out the remainder of the source
        line.</p>

        comments.</p>

      character constant for a newline.
    <p class="Pp">The nine trigraphs and their replacements are</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>

  for Linking</a></h2>
These options come into play when the compiler links object files into an
  executable output file. They are meaningless if the compiler is not doing a
  link step.
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>object-file-name</i></dt>
  <dd>A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is considered
      to name an object file or library. (Object files are distinguished from
      libraries by the linker according to the file contents.) If linking is
      done, these object files are used as input to the linker.</dd>
  <dt><b>-c</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-S</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-E</b></dt>
  <dd>If any of these options is used, then the linker is not run, and object
      file names should not be used as arguments.</dd>
  <dt><b>-flinker-output=</b><i>type</i></dt>
  <dd>This option controls the code generation of the link time optimizer. By
      default the linker output is determined by the linker plugin
      automatically. For debugging the compiler and in the case of incremental
      linking to non-lto object file is desired, it may be useful to control the
      type manually.
    <p class="Pp">If <i>type</i> is <b>exec</b> the code generation is
        configured to produce static binary. In this case <b>-fpic</b> and
        <b>-fpie</b> are both disabled.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <i>type</i> is <b>dyn</b> the code generation is configured
        to produce shared library. In this case <b>-fpic</b> or <b>-fPIC</b> is
        preserved, but not enabled automatically. This makes it possible to
        build shared libraries without position independent code on
        architectures this is possible, i.e. on x86.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <i>type</i> is <b>pie</b> the code generation is configured
        to produce <b>-fpie</b> executable. This result in similar optimizations
        as <b>exec</b> except that <b>-fpie</b> is not disabled if specified at
        compilation time.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If <i>type</i> is <b>rel</b> the compiler assumes that
        incremental linking is done. The sections containing intermediate code
        for link-time optimization are merged, pre-optimized, and output to the
        resulting object file. In addition, if <b>-ffat-lto-objects</b> is
        specified the binary code is produced for future non-lto linking. The
        object file produced by incremental linking will be smaller than a
        static library produced from the same object files. At link-time the
        result of incremental linking will also load faster to compiler than a
        static library assuming that majority of objects in the library are
        used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Finally <b>nolto-rel</b> configure compiler to for incremental
        linking where code generation is forced, final binary is produced and
        the intermediate code for later link-time optimization is stripped. When
        multiple object files are linked together the resulting code will be
        optimized better than with link time optimizations disabled (for
        example, the cross-module inlining will happen), most of benefits of
        whole program optimizations are however lost.</p>
    <p class="Pp">During the incremental link (by <b>-r</b>) the linker plugin
        will default to <b>rel</b>. With current interfaces to GNU Binutils it
        is however not possible to link incrementally LTO objects and non-LTO
        objects into a single mixed object file. In the case any of object files
        in incremental link cannot be used for link-time optimization the linker
        plugin will output warning and use <b>nolto-rel</b>. To maintain the
        whole program optimization it is recommended to link such objects into
        static library instead. Alternatively it is possible to use H.J. Lu's
        binutils with support for mixed objects.</p>

  <dd>Search the library named <i>library</i> when linking. (The second
      alternative with the library as a separate argument is only for POSIX
      compliance and is not recommended.)
    <p class="Pp">The <b>-l</b> option is passed directly to the linker by GCC.
        Refer to your linker documentation for exact details. The general
        description below applies to the GNU linker.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The linker searches a standard list of directories for the
        library. The directories searched include several standard system
        directories plus any that you specify with <b>-L</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Static libraries are archives of object files, and have file
        names like <i>lib</i><i>library</i><i>.a</i>. Some targets also support
        shared libraries, which typically have names like
        <i>lib</i><i>library</i> <i>.so</i>. If both static and shared libraries
        are found, the linker gives preference to linking with the shared
        library unless the <b>-static</b> option is used.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It makes a difference where in the command you write this
        option; the linker searches and processes libraries and object files in
        the order they are specified. Thus, <b>foo.o -lz bar.o</b> searches
        library <b>z</b> after file <i>foo.o</i> but before <i>bar.o</i>. If
        <i>bar.o</i> refers to functions in <b>z</b>, those functions may not be
        loaded.</p>

      normally, unless <b>-nostartfiles</b> is used.
    <p class="Pp">The compiler may generate calls to
        <span class="Li">&quot;memcmp&quot;</span>,

        <span class="Li">&quot;memcpy&quot;</span> and

      inclusion are used as well. This typically removes <b>-lc</b> from the
      link command line, as well as system libraries that normally go with it
      and become meaningless when absence of a C library is assumed, for example
      <b>-lpthread</b> or <b>-lm</b> in some configurations. This is intended
      for bare-board targets when there is indeed no C library available.</dd>
  <dt><b>-nostdlib</b></dt>
  <dd>Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries when linking. No
      startup files and only the libraries you specify are passed to the linker,

    <p class="Pp">One of the standard libraries bypassed by <b>-nostdlib</b> and

    <p class="Pp">In most cases, you need <i>libgcc.a</i> even when you want to
        avoid other standard libraries. In other words, when you specify
        <b>-nostdlib</b> or <b>-nodefaultlibs</b> you should usually specify
        <b>-lgcc</b> as well. This ensures that you have no unresolved
        references to internal GCC library subroutines. (An example of such an

      specify this linker option.</dd>
  <dt><b>-pthread</b></dt>
  <dd>Link with the POSIX threads library. This option is supported on GNU/Linux
      targets, most other Unix derivatives, and also on x86 Cygwin and MinGW

      so it should be used consistently for both compilation and linking.</dd>

      linking.</dd>
  <dt><b>-rdynamic</b></dt>
  <dd>Pass the flag <b>-export-dynamic</b> to the ELF linker, on targets that

  <dt><b>-shared</b></dt>
  <dd>Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to
      form an executable. Not all systems support this option. For predictable
      results, you must also specify the same set of options used for
      compilation (<b>-fpic</b>, <b>-fPIC</b>, or model suboptions) when you
      specify this linker option.[1]</dd>
  <dt><b>-shared-libgcc</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-static-libgcc</b></dt>
  <dd>On systems that provide <i>libgcc</i> as a shared library, these options
      force the use of either the shared or static version, respectively. If no
      shared version of <i>libgcc</i> was built when the compiler was
      configured, these options have no effect.
    <p class="Pp">There are several situations in which an application should
        use the shared <i>libgcc</i> instead of the static version. The most
        common of these is when the application wishes to throw and catch
        exceptions across different shared libraries. In that case, each of the
        libraries as well as the application itself should use the shared
        <i>libgcc</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Therefore, the G++ driver automatically adds
        <b>-shared-libgcc</b> whenever you build a shared library or a main
        executable, because C++ programs typically use exceptions, so this is
        the right thing to do.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If, instead, you use the GCC driver to create shared
        libraries, you may find that they are not always linked with the shared
        <i>libgcc</i>. If GCC finds, at its configuration time, that you have a
        non-GNU linker or a GNU linker that does not support option
        <b>--eh-frame-hdr</b>, it links the shared version of <i>libgcc</i> into
        shared libraries by default. Otherwise, it takes advantage of the linker
        and optimizes away the linking with the shared version of <i>libgcc</i>,
        linking with the static version of libgcc by default. This allows
        exceptions to propagate through such shared libraries, without incurring
        relocation costs at library load time.</p>
    <p class="Pp">However, if a library or main executable is supposed to throw
        or catch exceptions, you must link it using the G++ driver, or using the
        option <b>-shared-libgcc</b>, such that it is linked with the shared
        <i>libgcc</i>.</p>

  <dt><b>-Xlinker</b> <i>option</i></dt>
  <dd>Pass <i>option</i> as an option to the linker. You can use this to supply

    <p class="Pp">If you want to pass an option that takes a separate argument,
        you must use <b>-Xlinker</b> twice, once for the option and once for the
        argument. For example, to pass <b>-assert definitions</b>, you must
        write <b>-Xlinker -assert -Xlinker definitions</b>. It does not work to
        write <b>-Xlinker &quot;-assert definitions&quot;</b>, because this
        passes the entire string as a single argument, which is not what the

    <p class="Pp">When using the GNU linker, it is usually more convenient to
        pass arguments to linker options using the
        <i>option</i><b>=</b><i>value</i> syntax than as separate arguments. For
        example, you can specify <b>-Xlinker -Map=output.map</b> rather than
        <b>-Xlinker -Map -Xlinker output.map</b>. Other linkers may not support

  <dt><b>-Wl,</b><i>option</i></dt>
  <dd>Pass <i>option</i> as an option to the linker. If <i>option</i> contains

      syntax to pass an argument to the option. For example,
      <b>-Wl,-Map,output.map</b> passes <b>-Map output.map</b> to the linker.
      When using the GNU linker, you can also get the same effect with
      <b>-Wl,-Map=output.map</b>.
    <p class="Pp">NOTE: In Alpine Linux, for LDFLAGS, the option

      <span class="Li">$SYSROOT</span> is replaced by the sysroot prefix; see
      <b>--sysroot</b> and <b>-isysroot</b>.
    <p class="Pp">Directories specified with <b>-iquote</b> apply only to the

        Directories specified with <b>-I</b>, <b>-isystem</b>, or

        and
        <span class="Li">&quot;#include&#x00A0;&lt;</span><i>file</i><span class="Li">&gt;&quot;</span>
        directives.</p>
    <p class="Pp">You can specify any number or combination of these options on

<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">

</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">You can use <b>-I</b> to override a system header file,
    substituting your own version, since these directories are searched before
    the standard system header file directories. However, you should not use
    this option to add directories that contain vendor-supplied system header
    files; use <b>-isystem</b> for that.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-isystem</b> and <b>-idirafter</b> options also mark the

    that is applied to the standard system directories.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified
    with <b>-isystem</b>, is also specified with <b>-I</b>, the <b>-I</b> option
    is ignored. The directory is still searched but as a system directory at its
    normal position in the system include chain. This is to ensure that GCC's
    procedure to fix buggy system headers and the ordering for the
    <span class="Li">&quot;#include_next&quot;</span> directive are not
    inadvertently changed. If you really need to change the search order for
    system directories, use the <b>-nostdinc</b> and/or <b>-isystem</b>

<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd>Add directory <i>dir</i> to the list of directories to be searched for

  <dt><b>-B</b><i>prefix</i></dt>
  <dd>This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries, include
      files, and data files of the compiler itself.
    <p class="Pp">The compiler driver program runs one or more of the
        subprograms <b>cpp</b>, <b>cc1</b>, <b>as</b> and <b>ld</b>. It tries
        <i>prefix</i> as a prefix for each program it tries to run, both with
        and without <i>machine</i><b>/</b><i>version</i><b>/</b> for the
        corresponding target machine and compiler version.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries
        the <b>-B</b> prefix, if any. If that name is not found, or if <b>-B</b>
        is not specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes,
        <i>/usr/lib/gcc/</i> and <i>/usr/local/lib/gcc/</i>. If neither of those
        results in a file name that is found, the unmodified program name is
        searched for using the directories specified in your <b>PATH</b>
        environment variable.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The compiler checks to see if the path provided by <b>-B</b>
        refers to a directory, and if necessary it adds a directory separator
        character at the end of the path.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>-B</b> prefixes that effectively specify directory names
        also apply to libraries in the linker, because the compiler translates
        these options into <b>-L</b> options for the linker. They also apply to
        include files in the preprocessor, because the compiler translates these
        options into <b>-isystem</b> options for the preprocessor. In this case,
        the compiler appends <b>include</b> to the prefix.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The runtime support file <i>libgcc.a</i> can also be searched
        for using the <b>-B</b> prefix, if needed. If it is not found there, the
        two standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all. The file is left
        out of the link if it is not found by those means.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Another way to specify a prefix much like the <b>-B</b> prefix
        is to use the environment variable <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">As a special kludge, if the path provided by <b>-B</b> is
        <i>[dir/]stage</i><i>N</i><i>/</i>, where <i>N</i> is a number in the
        range 0 to 9, then it is replaced by <i>[dir/]include</i>. This is to
        help with boot-strapping the compiler.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-no-canonical-prefixes</b></dt>
  <dd>Do not expand any symbolic links, resolve references to <b>/../</b> or
      <b>/./</b>, or make the path absolute when generating a relative
    prefix.</dd>
  <dt><b>--sysroot=</b><i>dir</i></dt>
  <dd>Use <i>dir</i> as the logical root directory for headers and libraries.
      For example, if the compiler normally searches for headers in
      <i>/usr/include</i> and libraries in <i>/usr/lib</i>, it instead searches
      <i></i><i>dir</i><i>/usr/include</i> and <i></i><i>dir</i><i>/usr/lib</i>.
    <p class="Pp">If you use both this option and the <b>-isysroot</b> option,
        then the <b>--sysroot</b> option applies to libraries, but the
        <b>-isysroot</b> option applies to header files.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The GNU linker (beginning with version 2.16) has the necessary
        support for this option. If your linker does not support this option,
        the header file aspect of <b>--sysroot</b> still works, but the library
        aspect does not.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>--no-sysroot-suffix</b></dt>
  <dd>For some targets, a suffix is added to the root directory specified with
      <b>--sysroot</b>, depending on the other options used, so that headers may
      for example be found in
      <i></i><i>dir</i><i>/</i><i>suffix</i><i>/usr/include</i> instead of
      <i></i> <i>dir</i><i>/usr/include</i>. This option disables the addition
      of such a suffix.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-fstack-reuse=</b><i>reuse-level</i></dt>
  <dd>This option controls stack space reuse for user declared local/auto
      variables and compiler generated temporaries. <i>reuse_level</i> can be
      <b>all</b>, <b>named_vars</b>, or <b>none</b>. <b>all</b> enables stack
      reuse for all local variables and temporaries, <b>named_vars</b> enables
      the reuse only for user defined local variables with names, and
      <b>none</b> disables stack reuse completely. The default value is
      <b>all</b>. The option is needed when the program extends the lifetime of
      a scoped local variable or a compiler generated temporary beyond the end
      point defined by the language. When a lifetime of a variable ends, and if
      the variable lives in memory, the optimizing compiler has the freedom to
      reuse its stack space with other temporaries or scoped local variables
      whose live range does not overlap with it. Legacy code extending local
      lifetime is likely to break with the stack reuse optimization.

    <p class="Pp">The lifetime of a compiler generated temporary is well defined

  <dd>On systems with recent GNU assembler and C library, the C++ compiler uses

      about the binding of the symbol. But this causes

  <dt><b>-fno-common</b></dt>
  <dd>In C code, this option controls the placement of global variables defined
      without an initializer, known as <i>tentative definitions</i> in the C
      standard. Tentative definitions are distinct from declarations of a
      variable with the <span class="Li">&quot;extern&quot;</span> keyword,
      which do not allocate storage.
    <p class="Pp">Unix C compilers have traditionally allocated storage for
        uninitialized global variables in a common block. This allows the linker
        to resolve all tentative definitions of the same variable in different
        compilation units to the same object, or to a non-tentative definition.
        This is the behavior specified by <b>-fcommon</b>, and is the default
        for GCC on most targets. On the other hand, this behavior is not
        required by ISO C, and on some targets may carry a speed or code size
        penalty on variable references.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <b>-fno-common</b> option specifies that the compiler
        should instead place uninitialized global variables in the BSS section
        of the object file. This inhibits the merging of tentative definitions
        by the linker so you get a multiple-definition error if the same
        variable is defined in more than one compilation unit. Compiling with
        <b>-fno-common</b> is useful on targets for which it provides better
        performance, or if you wish to verify that the program will work on
        other systems that always treat uninitialized variable definitions this

      target and binary file format dependent, but it usually takes the form of
      a section containing ASCII text. This switch is related to the

      compiler options into the object file.</dd>
  <dt><b>-fpic</b></dt>
  <dd>Generate position-independent code (PIC) suitable for use in a shared
      library, if supported for the target machine. Such code accesses all
      constant addresses through a global offset table (GOT). The dynamic loader
      resolves the GOT entries when the program starts (the dynamic loader is
      not part of GCC; it is part of the operating system). If the GOT size for
      the linked executable exceeds a machine-specific maximum size, you get an
      error message from the linker indicating that <b>-fpic</b> does not work;
      in that case, recompile with <b>-fPIC</b> instead. (These maximums are 8k
      on the SPARC, 28k on AArch64 and 32k on the m68k and RS/6000. The x86 has
      no such limit.)
    <p class="Pp">Position-independent code requires special support, and
        therefore works only on certain machines. For the x86, GCC supports PIC

  <dd>Do not use the PLT for external function calls in position-independent
      code. Instead, load the callee address at call sites from the GOT and
      branch to it. This leads to more efficient code by eliminating PLT stubs
      and exposing GOT loads to optimizations. On architectures such as 32-bit
      x86 where PLT stubs expect the GOT pointer in a specific register, this
      gives more register allocation freedom to the compiler. Lazy binding
      requires use of the PLT; with <b>-fno-plt</b> all external symbols are
      resolved at load time.
    <p class="Pp">Alternatively, the function attribute

    <p class="Pp">A trampoline is a small piece of code that is created at run
        time on the stack when the address of a nested function is taken, and is

    <p class="Pp"><b>-fno-trampolines</b> is enabled by default on a language by

        with them. As of this writing, <b>-fno-trampolines</b> is enabled by
        default only for Ada.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Moreover, code compiled with <b>-ftrampolines</b> and code

  <dt><b>-fvisibility=</b>[<b>default</b>|<b>internal</b>|<b>hidden</b>|<b>protected</b>]</dt>
  <dd>Set the default ELF image symbol visibility to the specified option---all
      symbols are marked with this unless overridden within the code. Using this
      feature can very substantially improve linking and load times of shared
      object libraries, produce more optimized code, provide near-perfect API
      export and prevent symbol clashes. It is <b>strongly</b> recommended that
      you use this in any shared objects you distribute.
    <p class="Pp">Despite the nomenclature, <b>default</b> always means public;
        i.e., available to be linked against from outside the shared object.
        <b>protected</b> and <b>internal</b> are pretty useless in real-world
        usage so the only other commonly used option is <b>hidden</b>. The
        default if <b>-fvisibility</b> isn't specified is <b>default</b>, i.e.,
        make every symbol public.</p>
    <p class="Pp">A good explanation of the benefits offered by ensuring ELF
        symbols have the correct visibility is given by &quot;How To Write
        Shared Libraries&quot; by Ulrich Drepper (which can be found at
        &lt;<b>https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/</b>&gt;)---however a superior
        solution made possible by this option to marking things hidden when the
        default is public is to make the default hidden and mark things public.
        This is the norm with DLLs on Windows and with
        <b>-fvisibility=hidden</b> and <span class="Li">&quot;__attribute__
        ((visibility(&quot;default&quot;)))&quot;</span> instead of
        <span class="Li">&quot;__declspec(dllexport)&quot;</span> you get almost
        identical semantics with identical syntax. This is a great boon to those
        working with cross-platform projects.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For those adding visibility support to existing code, you may
        find <span class="Li">&quot;#pragma GCC visibility&quot;</span> of use.
        This works by you enclosing the declarations you wish to set visibility
        for with (for example) <span class="Li">&quot;#pragma GCC visibility
        push(hidden)&quot;</span> and <span class="Li">&quot;#pragma GCC
        visibility pop&quot;</span>. Bear in mind that symbol visibility should
        be viewed <b>as</b> <b>part of the API interface contract</b> and thus
        all new code should always specify visibility when it is not the
        default; i.e., declarations only for use within the local DSO should
        <b>always</b> be marked explicitly as hidden as so to avoid PLT
        indirection overheads---making this abundantly clear also aids
        readability and self-documentation of the code. Note that due to ISO C++
        specification requirements, <span class="Li">&quot;operator
        new&quot;</span> and <span class="Li">&quot;operator delete&quot;</span>
        must always be of default visibility.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Be aware that headers from outside your project, in particular
        system headers and headers from any other library you use, may not be
        expecting to be compiled with visibility other than the default. You may
        need to explicitly say <span class="Li">&quot;#pragma GCC visibility
        push(default)&quot;</span> before including any such headers.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;extern&quot;</span> declarations are
        not affected by <b>-fvisibility</b>, so a lot of code can be recompiled
        with <b>-fvisibility=hidden</b> with no modifications. However, this
        means that calls to <span class="Li">&quot;extern&quot;</span> functions
        with no explicit visibility use the PLT, so it is more effective to use
        <span class="Li">&quot;__attribute ((visibility))&quot;</span> and/or
        <span class="Li">&quot;#pragma GCC visibility&quot;</span> to tell the
        compiler which <span class="Li">&quot;extern&quot;</span> declarations
        should be treated as hidden.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that <b>-fvisibility</b> does affect C++ vague linkage
        entities. This means that, for instance, an exception class that is be
        thrown between DSOs must be explicitly marked with default visibility so
        that the <b>type_info</b> nodes are unified between the DSOs.</p>
    <p class="Pp">An overview of these techniques, their benefits and how to use
        them is at &lt;<b>http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility</b>&gt;.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-fstrict-volatile-bitfields</b></dt>
  <dd>This option should be used if accesses to volatile bit-fields (or other
      structure fields, although the compiler usually honors those types anyway)
      should use a single access of the width of the field's type, aligned to a
      natural alignment if possible. For example, targets with memory-mapped
      peripheral registers might require all such accesses to be 16 bits wide;
      with this flag you can declare all peripheral bit-fields as
      <span class="Li">&quot;unsigned short&quot;</span> (assuming short is 16
      bits on these targets) to force GCC to use 16-bit accesses instead of,
      perhaps, a more efficient 32-bit access.
    <p class="Pp">If this option is disabled, the compiler uses the most
        efficient instruction. In the previous example, that might be a 32-bit
        load instruction, even though that accesses bytes that do not contain
        any portion of the bit-field, or memory-mapped registers unrelated to
        the one being updated.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In some cases, such as when the
        <span class="Li">&quot;packed&quot;</span> attribute is applied to a
        structure field, it may not be possible to access the field with a
        single read or write that is correctly aligned for the target machine.
        In this case GCC falls back to generating multiple accesses rather than
        code that will fault or truncate the result at run time.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note: Due to restrictions of the C/C++11 memory model, write
        accesses are not allowed to touch non bit-field members. It is therefore
        recommended to define all bits of the field's type as bit-field
      members.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The default value of this option is determined by the
        application binary interface for the target processor.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-fsync-libcalls</b></dt>
  <dd>This option controls whether any out-of-line instance of the
      <span class="Li">&quot;__sync&quot;</span> family of functions may be used
      to implement the C++11 <span class="Li">&quot;__atomic&quot;</span> family
      of functions.
    <p class="Pp">The default value of this option is enabled, thus the only
        useful form of the option is <b>-fno-sync-libcalls</b>. This option is
        used in the implementation of the <i>libatomic</i> runtime library.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="_s-1GCC_s0_Developer_Options"><a class="permalink" href="#_s-1GCC_s0_Developer_Options">GCC
  Developer Options</a></h2>
This section describes command-line options that are primarily of interest to
  GCC developers, including options to support compiler testing and
  investigation of compiler bugs and compile-time performance problems. This
  includes options that produce debug dumps at various points in the
  compilation; that print statistics such as memory use and execution time; and
  that print information about GCC's configuration, such as where it searches
  for libraries. You should rarely need to use any of these options for ordinary
  compilation and linking tasks.
<p class="Pp">Many developer options that cause GCC to dump output to a file
    take an optional <b>=</b><i>filename</i> suffix. You can specify
    <b>stdout</b> or <b>-</b> to dump to standard output, and <b>stderr</b> for
    standard error.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>=</b><i>filename</i> is omitted, a default dump file name is
    constructed by concatenating the base dump file name, a pass number, phase
    letter, and pass name. The base dump file name is the name of output file
    produced by the compiler if explicitly specified and not an executable;
    otherwise it is the source file name. The pass number is determined by the
    order passes are registered with the compiler's pass manager. This is
    generally the same as the order of execution, but passes registered by
    plugins, target-specific passes, or passes that are otherwise registered
    late are numbered higher than the pass named <b>final</b>, even if they are
    executed earlier. The phase letter is one of <b>i</b> (inter-procedural
    analysis), <b>l</b> (language-specific), <b>r</b> (RTL), or <b>t</b> (tree).
    The files are created in the directory of the output file.</p>

  <dd>To enable the creation of the dump file, append the pass code to the

      enable the dump from the Early Value Range Propagation pass, invoke GCC
      with the <b>-fdump-tree-evrp</b> option. Optionally, you may specify the
      name of the dump file. If you don't specify one, GCC creates as described

  <dd>Find the pass dump in a file whose name is composed of three components

      letter <b>t</b> for tree passes (and the letter <b>r</b> for RTL passes),
      and finally the pass code. For example, the Early VRP pass dump might be
      in a file named <i>myfile.c.038t.evrp</i> in the current working
      directory. Note that the numeric codes are not stable and may change from
      one version of GCC to another.</dd>

      a preprocessed <i>foo.i</i> output file even though the compiler now
      normally uses an integrated preprocessor.
    <p class="Pp">When used in combination with the <b>-x</b> command-line
        option, <b>-save-temps</b> is sensible enough to avoid over writing an

</ul>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">The qualifier <span class="Li">&quot;static&quot;</span> means
    that the function manipulates the stack statically: a fixed number of bytes
    are allocated for the frame on function entry and released on function exit;
    no stack adjustments are otherwise made in the function. The second field is
    this fixed number of bytes.</p>
<p class="Pp">The qualifier <span class="Li">&quot;dynamic&quot;</span> means
    that the function manipulates the stack dynamically: in addition to the
    static allocation described above, stack adjustments are made in the body of
    the function, for example to push/pop arguments around function calls. If
    the qualifier <span class="Li">&quot;bounded&quot;</span> is also present,
    the amount of these adjustments is bounded at compile time and the second
    field is an upper bound of the total amount of stack used by the function.
    If it is not present, the amount of these adjustments is not bounded at
    compile time and the second field only represents the bounded part.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Machine-Dependent_Options"><a class="permalink" href="#Machine-Dependent_Options">Machine-Dependent
  Options</a></h2>
Each target machine supported by GCC can have its own options---for example, to
  allow you to compile for a particular processor variant or ABI, or to control
  optimizations specific to that machine. By convention, the names of
  machine-specific options start with <b>-m</b>.
<p class="Pp">Some configurations of the compiler also support additional
    target-specific options, usually for compatibility with other compilers on
    the same platform.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>AArch64 Options</i></p>
<p class="Pp">These options are defined for AArch64 implementations:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-mabi=</b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Generate code for the specified data model. Permissible values are
      <b>ilp32</b> for SysV-like data model where int, long int and pointers are
      32 bits, and <b>lp64</b> for SysV-like data model where int is 32 bits,
      but long int and pointers are 64 bits.
    <p class="Pp">The default depends on the specific target configuration. Note
        that the LP64 and ILP32 ABIs are not link-compatible; you must compile
        your entire program with the same ABI, and link with a compatible set of
        libraries.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-mbig-endian</b></dt>
  <dd>Generate big-endian code. This is the default when GCC is configured for
      an <b>aarch64_be-*-*</b> target.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mgeneral-regs-only</b></dt>
  <dd>Generate code which uses only the general-purpose registers. This will
      prevent the compiler from using floating-point and Advanced SIMD registers
      but will not impose any restrictions on the assembler.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mlittle-endian</b></dt>
  <dd>Generate little-endian code. This is the default when GCC is configured
      for an <b>aarch64-*-*</b> but not an <b>aarch64_be-*-*</b> target.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mcmodel=tiny</b></dt>
  <dd>Generate code for the tiny code model. The program and its statically
      defined symbols must be within 1MB of each other. Programs can be
      statically or dynamically linked.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mcmodel=small</b></dt>
  <dd>Generate code for the small code model. The program and its statically
      defined symbols must be within 4GB of each other. Programs can be
      statically or dynamically linked. This is the default code model.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mcmodel=large</b></dt>
  <dd>Generate code for the large code model. This makes no assumptions about
      addresses and sizes of sections. Programs can be statically linked
    only.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mstrict-align</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-mno-strict-align</b></dt>

      <b>pac-ret[+</b><i>leaf</i><b>]</b> turns on return address signing to its
      standard level: signing functions that save the return address to memory
      (non-leaf functions will practically always do this) using the a-key. The

  <dt><b>-msve-vector-bits=</b><i>bits</i></dt>
  <dd>Specify the number of bits in an SVE vector register. This option only has
      an effect when SVE is enabled.
    <p class="Pp">GCC supports two forms of SVE code generation:
        &quot;vector-length agnostic&quot; output that works with any size of
        vector register and &quot;vector-length specific&quot; output that
        allows GCC to make assumptions about the vector length when it is useful
        for optimization reasons. The possible values of <b>bits</b> are:
        <b>scalable</b>, <b>128</b>, <b>256</b>, <b>512</b>, <b>1024</b> and
        <b>2048</b>. Specifying <b>scalable</b> selects vector-length agnostic
        output. At present <b>-msve-vector-bits=128</b> also generates

<p class="Pp"><i>Adapteva Epiphany Options</i></p>
<p class="Pp">These <b>-m</b> options are defined for Adapteva Epiphany:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-mhalf-reg-file</b></dt>
  <dd>Don't allocate any register in the range
      <span class="Li">&quot;r32&quot;</span>...<span class="Li">&quot;r63&quot;</span>.
      That allows code to run on hardware variants that lack these
    registers.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mprefer-short-insn-regs</b></dt>
  <dd>Preferentially allocate registers that allow short instruction generation.
      This can result in increased instruction count, so this may either reduce
      or increase overall code size.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mbranch-cost=</b><i>num</i></dt>
  <dd>Set the cost of branches to roughly <i>num</i> &quot;simple&quot;
      instructions. This cost is only a heuristic and is not guaranteed to
      produce consistent results across releases.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mcmove</b></dt>
  <dd>Enable the generation of conditional moves.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mnops=</b><i>num</i></dt>
  <dd>Emit <i>num</i> NOPs before every other generated instruction.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mno-soft-cmpsf</b></dt>
  <dd>For single-precision floating-point comparisons, emit an
      <span class="Li">&quot;fsub&quot;</span> instruction and test the flags.
      This is faster than a software comparison, but can get incorrect results
      in the presence of NaNs, or when two different small numbers are compared
      such that their difference is calculated as zero. The default is
      <b>-msoft-cmpsf</b>, which uses slower, but IEEE-compliant, software
      comparisons.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mstack-offset=</b><i>num</i></dt>
  <dd>Set the offset between the top of the stack and the stack pointer. E.g., a
      value of 8 means that the eight bytes in the range
      <span class="Li">&quot;sp+0...sp+7&quot;</span> can be used by leaf
      functions without stack allocation. Values other than <b>8</b> or
      <b>16</b> are untested and unlikely to work. Note also that this option
      changes the ABI; compiling a program with a different stack offset than
      the libraries have been compiled with generally does not work. This option
      can be useful if you want to evaluate if a different stack offset would
      give you better code, but to actually use a different stack offset to
      build working programs, it is recommended to configure the toolchain with
      the appropriate <b>--with-stack-offset=</b><i>num</i> option.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mno-round-nearest</b></dt>
  <dd>Make the scheduler assume that the rounding mode has been set to
      truncating. The default is <b>-mround-nearest</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mlong-calls</b></dt>
  <dd>If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all calls might be
      beyond the offset range of the <span class="Li">&quot;b&quot;</span> /
      <span class="Li">&quot;bl&quot;</span> instructions, and therefore load
      the function address into a register before performing a (otherwise
      direct) call. This is the default.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mshort-calls</b></dt>
  <dd>If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all direct calls are in
      the range of the <span class="Li">&quot;b&quot;</span> /
      <span class="Li">&quot;bl&quot;</span> instructions, so use these
      instructions for direct calls. The default is <b>-mlong-calls</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-msmall16</b></dt>
  <dd>Assume addresses can be loaded as 16-bit unsigned values. This does not
      apply to function addresses for which <b>-mlong-calls</b> semantics are in
      effect.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mfp-mode=</b><i>mode</i></dt>
  <dd>Set the prevailing mode of the floating-point unit. This determines the
      floating-point mode that is provided and expected at function call and
      return time. Making this mode match the mode you predominantly need at
      function start can make your programs smaller and faster by avoiding
      unnecessary mode switches.
    <p class="Pp"><i>mode</i> can be set to one the following values:</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>caller</b></dt>
  <dd>Any mode at function entry is valid, and retained or restored when the
      function returns, and when it calls other functions. This mode is useful
      for compiling libraries or other compilation units you might want to
      incorporate into different programs with different prevailing FPU modes,
      and the convenience of being able to use a single object file outweighs
      the size and speed overhead for any extra mode switching that might be
      needed, compared with what would be needed with a more specific choice of
      prevailing FPU mode.</dd>
  <dt><b>truncate</b></dt>
  <dd>This is the mode used for floating-point calculations with truncating
      (i.e. round towards zero) rounding mode. That includes conversion from
      floating point to integer.</dd>
  <dt><b>round-nearest</b></dt>
  <dd>This is the mode used for floating-point calculations with
      round-to-nearest-or-even rounding mode.</dd>
  <dt><b>int</b></dt>
  <dd>This is the mode used to perform integer calculations in the FPU, e.g.
      integer multiply, or integer multiply-and-accumulate.</dd>

  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-mno-postinc</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-mno-postmodify</b></dt>
  <dd>Code generation tweaks that disable, respectively, splitting of 32-bit
      loads, generation of post-increment addresses, and generation of
      post-modify addresses. The defaults are <b>msplit-lohi</b>,
      <b>-mpost-inc</b>, and <b>-mpost-modify</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mnovect-double</b></dt>
  <dd>Change the preferred SIMD mode to SImode. The default is
      <b>-mvect-double</b>, which uses DImode as preferred SIMD mode.</dd>
  <dt><b>-max-vect-align=</b><i>num</i></dt>
  <dd>The maximum alignment for SIMD vector mode types. <i>num</i> may be 4 or
      8. The default is 8. Note that this is an ABI change, even though many
      library function interfaces are unaffected if they don't use SIMD vector
      modes in places that affect size and/or alignment of relevant types.</dd>
  <dt><b>-msplit-vecmove-early</b></dt>
  <dd>Split vector moves into single word moves before reload. In theory this
      can give better register allocation, but so far the reverse seems to be
      generally the case.</dd>
  <dt><b>-m1reg-</b><i>reg</i></dt>
  <dd>Specify a register to hold the constant -1, which makes loading small
      negative constants and certain bitmasks faster. Allowable values for
      <i>reg</i> are <b>r43</b> and <b>r63</b>, which specify use of that
      register as a fixed register, and <b>none</b>, which means that no

    <p class="Pp">Due to delay slot scheduling and interactions between operand
        numbers, literal sizes, instruction lengths, and the support for
        conditional execution, the target-independent pass to generate
        conditional execution is often lacking, so the ARC port has kept a
        special pass around that tries to find more conditional execution
        generation opportunities after register allocation, branch shortening,
        and delay slot scheduling have been done. This pass generally, but not
        always, improves performance and code size, at the cost of extra
        compilation time, which is why there is an option to switch it off. If
        you have a problem with call instructions exceeding their allowable

  <dt><b>-mmillicode</b></dt>
  <dd>When optimizing for size (using <b>-Os</b>), prologues and epilogues that

<p class="Pp">These <b>-m</b> options are defined for the ARM port:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-mabi=</b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Generate code for the specified ABI. Permissible values are:
      <b>apcs-gnu</b>, <b>atpcs</b>, <b>aapcs</b>, <b>aapcs-linux</b> and
      <b>iwmmxt</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mapcs-frame</b></dt>
  <dd>Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the ARM Procedure Call
      Standard for all functions, even if this is not strictly necessary for
      correct execution of the code. Specifying <b>-fomit-frame-pointer</b> with
      this option causes the stack frames not to be generated for leaf
      functions. The default is <b>-mno-apcs-frame</b>. This option is
      deprecated.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mapcs</b></dt>
  <dd>This is a synonym for <b>-mapcs-frame</b> and is deprecated.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mthumb-interwork</b></dt>
  <dd>Generate code that supports calling between the ARM and Thumb instruction
      sets. Without this option, on pre-v5 architectures, the two instruction
      sets cannot be reliably used inside one program. The default is
      <b>-mno-thumb-interwork</b>, since slightly larger code is generated when
      <b>-mthumb-interwork</b> is specified. In AAPCS configurations this option
      is meaningless.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mno-sched-prolog</b></dt>
  <dd>Prevent the reordering of instructions in the function prologue, or the
      merging of those instruction with the instructions in the function's body.
      This means that all functions start with a recognizable set of
      instructions (or in fact one of a choice from a small set of different
      function prologues), and this information can be used to locate the start
      of functions inside an executable piece of code. The default is
      <b>-msched-prolog</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mfloat-abi=</b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies which floating-point ABI to use. Permissible values are:
      <b>soft</b>, <b>softfp</b> and <b>hard</b>.
    <p class="Pp">Specifying <b>soft</b> causes GCC to generate output
        containing library calls for floating-point operations. <b>softfp</b>
        allows the generation of code using hardware floating-point
        instructions, but still uses the soft-float calling conventions.
        <b>hard</b> allows generation of floating-point instructions and uses
        FPU-specific calling conventions.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The default depends on the specific target configuration. Note
        that the hard-float and soft-float ABIs are not link-compatible; you
        must compile your entire program with the same ABI, and link with a
        compatible set of libraries.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-mgeneral-regs-only</b></dt>
  <dd>Generate code which uses only the general-purpose registers. This will
      prevent the compiler from using floating-point and Advanced SIMD registers
      but will not impose any restrictions on the assembler.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mlittle-endian</b></dt>
  <dd>Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode. This is the
      default for all standard configurations.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mbig-endian</b></dt>
  <dd>Generate code for a processor running in big-endian mode; the default is
      to compile code for a little-endian processor.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mbe8</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-mbe32</b></dt>
  <dd>When linking a big-endian image select between BE8 and BE32 formats. The
      option has no effect for little-endian images and is ignored. The default
      is dependent on the selected target architecture. For ARMv6 and later
      architectures the default is BE8, for older architectures the default is
      BE32. BE32 format has been deprecated by ARM.</dd>
  <dt><b>-march=</b><i>name</i>[<b>+extension...</b>]</dt>
  <dd>This specifies the name of the target ARM architecture. GCC uses this name
      to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when generating
      assembly code. This option can be used in conjunction with or instead of
      the <b>-mcpu=</b> option.
    <p class="Pp">Permissible names are: <b>armv4t</b>, <b>armv5t</b>,
        <b>armv5te</b>, <b>armv6</b>, <b>armv6j</b>, <b>armv6k</b>,
        <b>armv6kz</b>, <b>armv6t2</b>, <b>armv6z</b>, <b>armv6zk</b>,
        <b>armv7</b>, <b>armv7-a</b>, <b>armv7ve</b>, <b>armv8-a</b>,
        <b>armv8.1-a</b>, <b>armv8.2-a</b>, <b>armv8.3-a</b>, <b>armv8.4-a</b>,
        <b>armv8.5-a</b>, <b>armv7-r</b>, <b>armv8-r</b>, <b>armv6-m</b>,
        <b>armv6s-m</b>, <b>armv7-m</b>, <b>armv7e-m</b>, <b>armv8-m.base</b>,
        <b>armv8-m.main</b>, <b>iwmmxt</b> and <b>iwmmxt2</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Additionally, the following architectures, which lack support
        for the Thumb execution state, are recognized but support is deprecated:
        <b>armv4</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Many of the architectures support extensions. These can be
        added by appending <b>+</b><i>extension</i> to the architecture name.
        Extension options are processed in order and capabilities accumulate. An
        extension will also enable any necessary base extensions upon which it
        depends. For example, the <b>+crypto</b> extension will always enable
        the <b>+simd</b> extension. The exception to the additive construction
        is for extensions that are prefixed with <b>+no...</b>: these extensions
        disable the specified option and any other extensions that may depend on
        the presence of that extension.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For example, <b>-march=armv7-a+simd+nofp+vfpv4</b> is
        equivalent to writing <b>-march=armv7-a+vfpv4</b> since the <b>+simd</b>
        option is entirely disabled by the <b>+nofp</b> option that follows
      it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Most extension names are generically named, but have an effect
        that is dependent upon the architecture to which it is applied. For
        example, the <b>+simd</b> option can be applied to both <b>armv7-a</b>
        and <b>armv8-a</b> architectures, but will enable the original ARMv7-A
        Advanced SIMD (Neon) extensions for <b>armv7-a</b> and the ARMv8-A
        variant for <b>armv8-a</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The table below lists the supported extensions for each
        architecture. Architectures not mentioned do not support any
      extensions.</p>

      <b>neon-vfpv3</b> and <b>vfp</b> is an alias for <b>vfpv2</b>.
    <p class="Pp">The setting <b>auto</b> is the default and is special. It

      <b>-march</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the selected floating-point hardware includes the NEON

        are not generated by GCC's auto-vectorization pass unless
        <b>-funsafe-math-optimizations</b> is also specified. This is because
        NEON hardware does not fully implement the IEEE 754 standard for
        floating-point arithmetic (in particular denormal values are treated as
        zero), so the use of NEON instructions may lead to a loss of

  </dd>
  <dt><b>-mfp16-format=</b><i>name</i></dt>

      half-precision floating-point type. Permissible names are <b>none</b>,
      <b>ieee</b>, and <b>alternative</b>; the default is <b>none</b>, in which

  <dt><b>-mstructure-size-boundary=</b><i>n</i></dt>
  <dd>The sizes of all structures and unions are rounded up to a multiple of the
      number of bits set by this option. Permissible values are 8, 32 and 64.
      The default value varies for different toolchains. For the COFF targeted
      toolchain the default value is 8. A value of 64 is only allowed if the
      underlying ABI supports it.
    <p class="Pp">Specifying a larger number can produce faster, more efficient
        code, but can also increase the size of the program. Different values
        are potentially incompatible. Code compiled with one value cannot
        necessarily expect to work with code or libraries compiled with another
        value, if they exchange information using structures or unions.</p>

  <dt><b>-mabort-on-noreturn</b></dt>
  <dd>Generate a call to the function <span class="Li">&quot;abort&quot;</span>

  <dt><b>-mlong-calls</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-mno-long-calls</b></dt>
  <dd>Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading the address
      of the function into a register and then performing a subroutine call on
      this register. This switch is needed if the target function lies outside
      of the 64-megabyte addressing range of the offset-based version of
      subroutine call instruction.
    <p class="Pp">Even if this switch is enabled, not all function calls are
        turned into long calls. The heuristic is that static functions,
        functions that have the <span class="Li">&quot;short_call&quot;</span>
        attribute, functions that are inside the scope of a
        <span class="Li">&quot;#pragma no_long_calls&quot;</span> directive, and
        functions whose definitions have already been compiled within the
        current compilation unit are not turned into long calls. The exceptions
        to this rule are that weak function definitions, functions with the
        <span class="Li">&quot;long_call&quot;</span> attribute or the
        <span class="Li">&quot;section&quot;</span> attribute, and functions
        that are within the scope of a <span class="Li">&quot;#pragma
        long_calls&quot;</span> directive are always turned into long calls.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This feature is not enabled by default. Specifying
        <b>-mno-long-calls</b> restores the default behavior, as does placing
        the function calls within the scope of a
        <span class="Li">&quot;#pragma</span>
        <span class="Li">long_calls_off&quot;</span> directive. Note these
        switches have no effect on how the compiler generates code to handle
        function calls via function pointers.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-msingle-pic-base</b></dt>
  <dd>Treat the register used for PIC addressing as read-only, rather than
      loading it in the prologue for each function. The runtime system is
      responsible for initializing this register with an appropriate value
      before execution begins.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mpic-register=</b><i>reg</i></dt>
  <dd>Specify the register to be used for PIC addressing. For standard PIC base
      case, the default is any suitable register determined by compiler. For
      single PIC base case, the default is <b>R9</b> if target is EABI based or
      stack-checking is enabled, otherwise the default is <b>R10</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mpic-data-is-text-relative</b></dt>
  <dd>Assume that the displacement between the text and data segments is fixed
      at static link time. This permits using PC-relative addressing operations
      to access data known to be in the data segment. For non-VxWorks RTP
      targets, this option is enabled by default. When disabled on such targets,
      it will enable <b>-msingle-pic-base</b> by default.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mpoke-function-name</b></dt>
  <dd>Write the name of each function into the text section, directly preceding
      the function prologue. The generated code is similar to this:

    <pre>
             t0
                 .ascii &quot;arm_poke_function_name&quot;, 0

                 sub     fp, ip, #4
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">When performing a stack backtrace, code can inspect the value
        of <span class="Li">&quot;pc&quot;</span> stored at
        <span class="Li">&quot;fp + 0&quot;</span>. If the trace function then
        looks at location <span class="Li">&quot;pc - 12&quot;</span> and the
        top 8 bits are set, then we know that there is a function name embedded
        immediately preceding this location and has length

  <dt><b>-mthumb</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-marm</b></dt>
  <dd>Select between generating code that executes in ARM and Thumb states. The
      default for most configurations is to generate code that executes in ARM

      <b>--with-mode=</b><i>state</i> configure option.
    <p class="Pp">You can also override the ARM and Thumb mode for each function

        attributes or pragmas.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-mflip-thumb</b></dt>
  <dd>Switch ARM/Thumb modes on alternating functions. This option is provided
      for regression testing of mixed Thumb/ARM code generation, and is not
      intended for ordinary use in compiling code.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mtpcs-frame</b></dt>
  <dd>Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure Call
      Standard for all non-leaf functions. (A leaf function is one that does not
      call any other functions.) The default is <b>-mno-tpcs-frame</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mtpcs-leaf-frame</b></dt>
  <dd>Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the Thumb Procedure Call
      Standard for all leaf functions. (A leaf function is one that does not
      call any other functions.) The default is
    <b>-mno-apcs-leaf-frame</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mcallee-super-interworking</b></dt>
  <dd>Gives all externally visible functions in the file being compiled an ARM
      instruction set header which switches to Thumb mode before executing the
      rest of the function. This allows these functions to be called from
      non-interworking code. This option is not valid in AAPCS configurations
      because interworking is enabled by default.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mcaller-super-interworking</b></dt>
  <dd>Allows calls via function pointers (including virtual functions) to
      execute correctly regardless of whether the target code has been compiled
      for interworking or not. There is a small overhead in the cost of
      executing a function pointer if this option is enabled. This option is not
      valid in AAPCS configurations because interworking is enabled by
    default.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mtp=</b><i>name</i></dt>
  <dd>Specify the access model for the thread local storage pointer. The valid
      models are <b>soft</b>, which generates calls to
      <span class="Li">&quot;__aeabi_read_tp&quot;</span>, <b>cp15</b>, which
      fetches the thread pointer from <span class="Li">&quot;cp15&quot;</span>
      directly (supported in the arm6k architecture), and <b>auto</b>, which
      uses the best available method for the selected processor. The default
      setting is <b>auto</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mtls-dialect=</b><i>dialect</i></dt>
  <dd>Specify the dialect to use for accessing thread local storage. Two
      <i>dialect</i>s are supported---<b>gnu</b> and <b>gnu2</b>. The <b>gnu</b>
      dialect selects the original GNU scheme for supporting local and global
      dynamic TLS models. The <b>gnu2</b> dialect selects the GNU descriptor
      scheme, which provides better performance for shared libraries. The GNU
      descriptor scheme is compatible with the original scheme, but does require
      new assembler, linker and library support. Initial and local exec TLS
      models are unaffected by this option and always use the original
    scheme.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mword-relocations</b></dt>
  <dd>Only generate absolute relocations on word-sized values (i.e.
      R_ARM_ABS32). This is enabled by default on targets (uClinux, SymbianOS)
      where the runtime loader imposes this restriction, and when <b>-fpic</b>
      or <b>-fPIC</b> is specified. This option conflicts with
      <b>-mslow-flash-data</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mfix-cortex-m3-ldrd</b></dt>
  <dd>Some Cortex-M3 cores can cause data corruption when
      <span class="Li">&quot;ldrd&quot;</span> instructions with overlapping
      destination and base registers are used. This option avoids generating
      these instructions. This option is enabled by default when

  <dt><b>-munaligned-access</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-mno-unaligned-access</b></dt>
  <dd>Enables (or disables) reading and writing of 16- and 32- bit values from
      addresses that are not 16- or 32- bit aligned. By default unaligned access
      is disabled for all pre-ARMv6, all ARMv6-M and for ARMv8-M Baseline
      architectures, and enabled for all other architectures. If unaligned
      access is not enabled then words in packed data structures are accessed a
      byte at a time.
    <p class="Pp">The ARM attribute
        <span class="Li">&quot;Tag_CPU_unaligned_access&quot;</span> is set in
        the generated object file to either true or false, depending upon the
        setting of this option. If unaligned access is enabled then the
        preprocessor symbol
        <span class="Li">&quot;__ARM_FEATURE_UNALIGNED&quot;</span> is also
        defined.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-mneon-for-64bits</b></dt>
  <dd>Enables using Neon to handle scalar 64-bits operations. This is disabled
      by default since the cost of moving data from core registers to Neon is
      high.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mslow-flash-data</b></dt>
  <dd>Assume loading data from flash is slower than fetching instruction.
      Therefore literal load is minimized for better performance. This option is
      only supported when compiling for ARMv7 M-profile and off by default. It
      conflicts with <b>-mword-relocations</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-masm-syntax-unified</b></dt>
  <dd>Assume inline assembler is using unified asm syntax. The default is
      currently off which implies divided syntax. This option has no impact on
      Thumb2. However, this may change in future releases of GCC. Divided syntax
      should be considered deprecated.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mrestrict-it</b></dt>
  <dd>Restricts generation of IT blocks to conform to the rules of ARMv8-A. IT
      blocks can only contain a single 16-bit instruction from a select set of
      instructions. This option is on by default for ARMv8-A Thumb mode.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mprint-tune-info</b></dt>
  <dd>Print CPU tuning information as comment in assembler file. This is an

<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;EIND&quot;</span> and Devices with More
    Than 128 Ki Bytes of Flash</p>
<p class="Pp">Pointers in the implementation are 16@tie{}bits wide. The address
    of a function or label is represented as word address so that indirect jumps
    and calls can target any code address in the range of 64@tie{}Ki words.</p>
<p class="Pp">In order to facilitate indirect jump on devices with more than
    128@tie{}Ki bytes of program memory space, there is a special function
    register called <span class="Li">&quot;EIND&quot;</span> that serves as most
    significant part of the target address when
    <span class="Li">&quot;EICALL&quot;</span> or
    <span class="Li">&quot;EIJMP&quot;</span> instructions are used.</p>
<p class="Pp">Indirect jumps and calls on these devices are handled as follows
    by the compiler and are subject to some limitations:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The compiler never sets <span class="Li">&quot;EIND&quot;</span>.</li>
  <li>The compiler uses <span class="Li">&quot;EIND&quot;</span> implicitly in
      <span class="Li">&quot;EICALL&quot;</span>/<span class="Li">&quot;EIJMP&quot;</span>
      instructions or might read <span class="Li">&quot;EIND&quot;</span>
      directly in order to emulate an indirect call/jump by means of a
      <span class="Li">&quot;RET&quot;</span> instruction.</li>
  <li>The compiler assumes that <span class="Li">&quot;EIND&quot;</span> never
      changes during the startup code or during the application. In particular,
      <span class="Li">&quot;EIND&quot;</span> is not saved/restored in function
      or interrupt service routine prologue/epilogue.</li>
  <li>For indirect calls to functions and computed goto, the linker generates
      <i>stubs</i>. Stubs are jump pads sometimes also called
      <i>trampolines</i>. Thus, the indirect call/jump jumps to such a stub. The
      stub contains a direct jump to the desired address.</li>
  <li>Linker relaxation must be turned on so that the linker generates the stubs
      correctly in all situations. See the compiler option <b>-mrelax</b> and
      the linker option <b>--relax</b>. There are corner cases where the linker
      is supposed to generate stubs but aborts without relaxation and without a
      helpful error message.</li>
  <li>The default linker script is arranged for code with
      <span class="Li">&quot;EIND = 0&quot;</span>. If code is supposed to work
      for a setup with <span class="Li">&quot;EIND != 0&quot;</span>, a custom
      linker script has to be used in order to place the sections whose name
      start with <span class="Li">&quot;.trampolines&quot;</span> into the
      segment where <span class="Li">&quot;EIND&quot;</span> points to.</li>
  <li>The startup code from libgcc never sets
      <span class="Li">&quot;EIND&quot;</span>. Notice that startup code is a
      blend of code from libgcc and AVR-LibC. For the impact of AVR-LibC on
      <span class="Li">&quot;EIND&quot;</span>, see the
      AVR-LibC&#x00A0;user&#x00A0;manual
      (<span class="Li">&quot;http://nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/&quot;</span>).</li>
  <li>It is legitimate for user-specific startup code to set up
      <span class="Li">&quot;EIND&quot;</span> early, for example by means of
      initialization code located in section
      <span class="Li">&quot;.init3&quot;</span>. Such code runs prior to
      general startup code that initializes RAM and calls constructors, but
      after the bit of startup code from AVR-LibC that sets
      <span class="Li">&quot;EIND&quot;</span> to the segment where the vector
      table is located.

      of the 24-bit addressing range of the offset-based version of subroutine
      call instruction.

<p class="Pp"><i>Darwin Options</i></p>
<p class="Pp">These options are defined for all architectures running the Darwin
    operating system.</p>
<p class="Pp">FSF GCC on Darwin does not create &quot;fat&quot; object files; it
    creates an object file for the single architecture that GCC was built to
    target. Apple's GCC on Darwin does create &quot;fat&quot; files if multiple
    <b>-arch</b> options are used; it does so by running the compiler or linker
    multiple times and joining the results together with <i>lipo</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The subtype of the file created (like <b>ppc7400</b> or
    <b>ppc970</b> or <b>i686</b>) is determined by the flags that specify the
    ISA that GCC is targeting, like <b>-mcpu</b> or <b>-march</b>. The
    <b>-force_cpusubtype_ALL</b> option can be used to override this.</p>
<p class="Pp">The Darwin tools vary in their behavior when presented with an ISA
    mismatch. The assembler, <i>as</i>, only permits instructions to be used
    that are valid for the subtype of the file it is generating, so you cannot
    put 64-bit instructions in a <b>ppc750</b> object file. The linker for
    shared libraries, <i>/usr/bin/libtool</i>, fails and prints an error if
    asked to create a shared library with a less restrictive subtype than its
    input files (for instance, trying to put a <b>ppc970</b> object file in a
    <b>ppc7400</b> library). The linker for executables, <b>ld</b>, quietly
    gives the executable the most restrictive subtype of any of its input
  files.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-F</b><i>dir</i></dt>
  <dd>Add the framework directory <i>dir</i> to the head of the list of
      directories to be searched for header files. These directories are
      interleaved with those specified by <b>-I</b> options and are scanned in a
      left-to-right order.
    <p class="Pp">A framework directory is a directory with frameworks in it. A
        framework is a directory with a <i>Headers</i> and/or
        <i>PrivateHeaders</i> directory contained directly in it that ends in
        <i>.framework</i>. The name of a framework is the name of this directory
        excluding the <i>.framework</i>. Headers associated with the framework
        are found in one of those two directories, with <i>Headers</i> being
        searched first. A subframework is a framework directory that is in a
        framework's <i>Frameworks</i> directory. Includes of subframework
        headers can only appear in a header of a framework that contains the
        subframework, or in a sibling subframework header. Two subframeworks are
        siblings if they occur in the same framework. A subframework should not
        have the same name as a framework; a warning is issued if this is
        violated. Currently a subframework cannot have subframeworks; in the
        future, the mechanism may be extended to support this. The standard
        frameworks can be found in <i>/System/Library/Frameworks</i> and
        <i>/Library/Frameworks</i>. An example include looks like
        <span class="Li">&quot;#include &lt;Framework/header.h&gt;&quot;</span>,
        where <i>Framework</i> denotes the name of the framework and
        <i>header.h</i> is found in the <i>PrivateHeaders</i> or <i>Headers</i>
        directory.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-iframework</b><i>dir</i></dt>
  <dd>Like <b>-F</b> except the directory is a treated as a system directory.
      The main difference between this <b>-iframework</b> and <b>-F</b> is that
      with <b>-iframework</b> the compiler does not warn about constructs
      contained within header files found via <i>dir</i>. This option is valid
      only for the C family of languages.</dd>
  <dt><b>-gused</b></dt>
  <dd>Emit debugging information for symbols that are used. For stabs debugging
      format, this enables <b>-feliminate-unused-debug-symbols</b>. This is by
      default ON.</dd>
  <dt><b>-gfull</b></dt>
  <dd>Emit debugging information for all symbols and types.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mmacosx-version-min=</b><i>version</i></dt>
  <dd>The earliest version of MacOS X that this executable will run on is

      <span class="Li">10.1</span>, <span class="Li">10.2</span>, and
      <span class="Li">10.3.9</span>.
    <p class="Pp">If the compiler was built to use the system's headers by
        default, then the default for this option is the system version on which
        the compiler is running, otherwise the default is to make choices that
        are compatible with as many systems and code bases as possible.</p>

      <b>-fapple-kext</b>, <b>-fno-weak</b> and <b>-fno-rtti</b> where
      applicable. This mode also sets <b>-mno-altivec</b>, <b>-msoft-float</b>,
      <b>-fno-builtin</b> and <b>-mlong-branch</b> for PowerPC targets.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mone-byte-bool</b></dt>
  <dd>Override the defaults for <span class="Li">&quot;bool&quot;</span> so that

      <span class="Li">4</span> when compiling for Darwin/PowerPC and
      <span class="Li">1</span> when compiling for Darwin/x86, so this option
      has no effect on x86.
    <p class="Pp"><b>Warning:</b> The <b>-mone-byte-bool</b> switch causes GCC

  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-msoft-float</b></dt>
  <dd>Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions for
      floating-point operations. When <b>-msoft-float</b> is specified,
      functions in <i>libgcc.a</i> are used to perform floating-point
      operations. Unless they are replaced by routines that emulate the
      floating-point operations, or compiled in such a way as to call such
      emulations routines, these routines issue floating-point operations. If
      you are compiling for an Alpha without floating-point operations, you must
      ensure that the library is built so as not to call them.
    <p class="Pp">Note that Alpha implementations without floating-point

      <b>-mno-fp-regs</b> implies <b>-msoft-float</b>. If the floating-point
      register set is not used, floating-point operands are passed in integer
      registers as if they were integers and floating-point results are passed
      in <span class="Li">$0</span> instead of <span class="Li">$f0</span>. This
      is a non-standard calling sequence, so any function with a floating-point
      argument or return value called by code compiled with <b>-mno-fp-regs</b>
      must also be compiled with that option.
    <p class="Pp">A typical use of this option is building a kernel that does

  <dt><b>-mieee</b></dt>
  <dd>The Alpha architecture implements floating-point hardware optimized for

      This option generates code fully IEEE-compliant code <i>except</i> that
      the <i>inexact-flag</i> is not maintained (see below). If this option is
      turned on, the preprocessor macro
      <span class="Li">&quot;_IEEE_FP&quot;</span> is defined during
      compilation. The resulting code is less efficient but is able to correctly

<p class="Pp"><i>HPPA Options</i></p>
<p class="Pp">These <b>-m</b> options are defined for the HPPA family of
    computers:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-march=</b><i>architecture-type</i></dt>
  <dd>Generate code for the specified architecture. The choices for
      <i>architecture-type</i> are <b>1.0</b> for PA 1.0, <b>1.1</b> for PA 1.1,
      and <b>2.0</b> for PA 2.0 processors. Refer to
      <i>/usr/lib/sched.models</i> on an HP-UX system to determine the proper

  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-mpa-risc-1-1</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-mpa-risc-2-0</b></dt>
  <dd>Synonyms for <b>-march=1.0</b>, <b>-march=1.1</b>, and <b>-march=2.0</b>
      respectively.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mcaller-copies</b></dt>
  <dd>The caller copies function arguments passed by hidden reference. This
      option should be used with care as it is not compatible with the default
      32-bit runtime. However, only aggregates larger than eight bytes are
      passed by hidden reference and the option provides better compatibility
      with OpenMP.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mjump-in-delay</b></dt>
  <dd>This option is ignored and provided for compatibility purposes only.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mdisable-fpregs</b></dt>
  <dd>Prevent floating-point registers from being used in any manner. This is
      necessary for compiling kernels that perform lazy context switching of
      floating-point registers. If you use this option and attempt to perform
      floating-point operations, the compiler aborts.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mdisable-indexing</b></dt>
  <dd>Prevent the compiler from using indexing address modes. This avoids some
      rather obscure problems when compiling MIG generated code under MACH.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mno-space-regs</b></dt>
  <dd>Generate code that assumes the target has no space registers. This allows
      GCC to generate faster indirect calls and use unscaled index address
      modes.
    <p class="Pp">Such code is suitable for level 0 PA systems and kernels.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-mfast-indirect-calls</b></dt>
  <dd>Generate code that assumes calls never cross space boundaries. This allows
      GCC to emit code that performs faster indirect calls.
    <p class="Pp">This option does not work in the presence of shared libraries
        or nested functions.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-mfixed-range=</b><i>register-range</i></dt>
  <dd>Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers. A
      fixed register is one that the register allocator cannot use. This is
      useful when compiling kernel code. A register range is specified as two
      registers separated by a dash. Multiple register ranges can be specified
      separated by a comma.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mlong-load-store</b></dt>
  <dd>Generate 3-instruction load and store sequences as sometimes required by
      the HP-UX 10 linker. This is equivalent to the <b>+k</b> option to the HP
      compilers.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mportable-runtime</b></dt>
  <dd>Use the portable calling conventions proposed by HP for ELF systems.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mgas</b></dt>
  <dd>Enable the use of assembler directives only GAS understands.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mschedule=</b><i>cpu-type</i></dt>
  <dd>Schedule code according to the constraints for the machine type
      <i>cpu-type</i>. The choices for <i>cpu-type</i> are <b>700</b>
      <b>7100</b>, <b>7100LC</b>, <b>7200</b>, <b>7300</b> and <b>8000</b>.
      Refer to <i>/usr/lib/sched.models</i> on an HP-UX system to determine the
      proper scheduling option for your machine. The default scheduling is
      <b>8000</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mlinker-opt</b></dt>
  <dd>Enable the optimization pass in the HP-UX linker. Note this makes symbolic
      debugging impossible. It also triggers a bug in the HP-UX 8 and HP-UX 9
      linkers in which they give bogus error messages when linking some
      programs.</dd>
  <dt><b>-msoft-float</b></dt>
  <dd>Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
      <b>Warning:</b> the requisite libraries are not available for all HPPA
      targets. Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
      used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation. You must make
      your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
      cross-compilation.
    <p class="Pp"><b>-msoft-float</b> changes the calling convention in the
        output file; therefore, it is only useful if you compile <i>all</i> of a
        program with this option. In particular, you need to compile
        <i>libgcc.a</i>, the library that comes with GCC, with
        <b>-msoft-float</b> in order for this to work.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-msio</b></dt>
  <dd>Generate the predefine, <span class="Li">&quot;_SIO&quot;</span>, for
      server IO. The default is <b>-mwsio</b>. This generates the predefines,
      <span class="Li">&quot;__hp9000s700&quot;</span>,
      <span class="Li">&quot;__hp9000s700__&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;_WSIO&quot;</span>, for workstation IO. These
      options are available under HP-UX and HI-UX.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mgnu-ld</b></dt>
  <dd>Use options specific to GNU <b>ld</b>. This passes <b>-shared</b> to
      <b>ld</b> when building a shared library. It is the default when GCC is
      configured, explicitly or implicitly, with the GNU linker. This option
      does not affect which <b>ld</b> is called; it only changes what parameters
      are passed to that <b>ld</b>. The <b>ld</b> that is called is determined
      by the <b>--with-ld</b> configure option, GCC's program search path, and
      finally by the user's <b>PATH</b>. The linker used by GCC can be printed
      using <b>which `gcc -print-prog-name=ld`</b>. This option is only
      available on the 64-bit HP-UX GCC, i.e. configured with
      <b>hppa*64*-*-hpux*</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mhp-ld</b></dt>
  <dd>Use options specific to HP <b>ld</b>. This passes <b>-b</b> to <b>ld</b>
      when building a shared library and passes <b>+Accept TypeMismatch</b> to
      <b>ld</b> on all links. It is the default when GCC is configured,
      explicitly or implicitly, with the HP linker. This option does not affect
      which <b>ld</b> is called; it only changes what parameters are passed to
      that <b>ld</b>. The <b>ld</b> that is called is determined by the
      <b>--with-ld</b> configure option, GCC's program search path, and finally
      by the user's <b>PATH</b>. The linker used by GCC can be printed using
      <b>which</b> <b>`gcc -print-prog-name=ld`</b>. This option is only
      available on the 64-bit HP-UX GCC, i.e. configured with
      <b>hppa*64*-*-hpux*</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mlong-calls</b></dt>
  <dd>Generate code that uses long call sequences. This ensures that a call is
      always able to reach linker generated stubs. The default is to generate
      long calls only when the distance from the call site to the beginning of
      the function or translation unit, as the case may be, exceeds a predefined
      limit set by the branch type being used. The limits for normal calls are
      7,600,000 and 240,000 bytes, respectively for the PA 2.0 and PA 1.X
      architectures. Sibcalls are always limited at 240,000 bytes.
    <p class="Pp">Distances are measured from the beginning of functions when
        using the <b>-ffunction-sections</b> option, or when using the
        <b>-mgas</b> and <b>-mno-portable-runtime</b> options together under
        HP-UX with the SOM linker.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It is normally not desirable to use this option as it degrades
        performance. However, it may be useful in large applications,
        particularly when partial linking is used to build the application.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The types of long calls used depends on the capabilities of
        the assembler and linker, and the type of code being generated. The
        impact on systems that support long absolute calls, and long pic
        symbol-difference or pc-relative calls should be relatively small.
        However, an indirect call is used on 32-bit ELF systems in pic code and
        it is quite long.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-munix=</b><i>unix-std</i></dt>
  <dd>Generate compiler predefines and select a startfile for the specified UNIX
      standard. The choices for <i>unix-std</i> are <b>93</b>, <b>95</b> and
      <b>98</b>. <b>93</b> is supported on all HP-UX versions. <b>95</b> is
      available on HP-UX 10.10 and later. <b>98</b> is available on HP-UX 11.11
      and later. The default values are <b>93</b> for HP-UX 10.00, <b>95</b> for
      HP-UX 10.10 though to 11.00, and <b>98</b> for HP-UX 11.11 and later.
    <p class="Pp"><b>-munix=93</b> provides the same predefines as GCC 3.3 and
        3.4. <b>-munix=95</b> provides additional predefines for
        <span class="Li">&quot;XOPEN_UNIX&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED&quot;</span>, and the

        <span class="Li">&quot;_INCLUDE_XOPEN_SOURCE_500&quot;</span>, and the
        startfile <i>unix98.o</i>.</p>
    <p class="Pp">It is <i>important</i> to note that this option changes the
        interfaces for various library routines. It also affects the operational
        behavior of the C library. Thus, <i>extreme</i> care is needed in using
        this option.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Library code that is intended to operate with more than one
        UNIX standard must test, set and restore the variable
        <span class="Li">&quot;__xpg4_extended_mask&quot;</span> as appropriate.
        Most GNU software doesn't provide this capability.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-nolibdld</b></dt>
  <dd>Suppress the generation of link options to search libdld.sl when the
      <b>-static</b> option is specified on HP-UX 10 and later.</dd>
  <dt><b>-static</b></dt>
  <dd>The HP-UX implementation of setlocale in libc has a dependency on
      libdld.sl. There isn't an archive version of libdld.sl. Thus, when the
      <b>-static</b> option is specified, special link options are needed to
      resolve this dependency.
    <p class="Pp">On HP-UX 10 and later, the GCC driver adds the necessary
        options to link with libdld.sl when the <b>-static</b> option is
        specified. This causes the resulting binary to be dynamic. On the 64-bit
        port, the linkers generate dynamic binaries by default in any case. The
        <b>-nolibdld</b> option can be used to prevent the GCC driver from
        adding these link options.</p>

  <dd>Specifies that the program will be run on the simulator. This causes an
      alternate runtime library to be linked in which supports, for example,
      file I/O. You must not use this option when generating programs that will
      run on real hardware; you must provide your own runtime library for

  <dt><b>-memregs=</b><i>number</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the number of memory-based pseudo-registers GCC uses during code
      generation. These pseudo-registers are used like real registers, so there
      is a tradeoff between GCC's ability to fit the code into available
      registers, and the performance penalty of using memory instead of
      registers. Note that all modules in a program must be compiled with the
      same value for this option. Because of that, you must not use this option
      with GCC's default runtime libraries.</dd>

  <dd>Specifies the identification number of the ID-based shared library being

  <dd>When generating position-independent code for ColdFire, generate code that

      option is not needed; <b>-fPIC</b> suffices.
    <p class="Pp">GCC normally uses a single instruction to load values from the
        GOT. While this is relatively efficient, it only works if the GOT is
        smaller than about 64k. Anything larger causes the linker to report an
        error such as:</p>

        generated with <b>-mxgot</b> is less efficient, since it takes 4
        instructions to fetch the value of a global symbol.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that some linkers, including newer versions of the GNU
        linker, can create multiple GOTs and sort GOT entries. If you have such
        a linker, you should only need to use <b>-mxgot</b> when compiling a

  <dd>Generate code for the given ABI.
    <p class="Pp">Note that the EABI has a 32-bit and a 64-bit variant. GCC
        normally generates 64-bit code when you select a 64-bit architecture,
        but you can use <b>-mgp32</b> to get 32-bit code instead.</p>
    <p class="Pp">For information about the O64 ABI, see
        &lt;<b>http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/mipso64-abi.html</b>&gt;.</p>
    <p class="Pp">GCC supports a variant of the o32 ABI in which floating-point
        registers are 64 rather than 32 bits wide. You can select this
        combination with <b>-mabi=32</b> <b>-mfp64</b>. This ABI relies on the
        <span class="Li">&quot;mthc1&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;mfhc1&quot;</span> instructions and is therefore
        only supported for MIPS32R2, MIPS32R3 and MIPS32R5 processors.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The register assignments for arguments and return values
        remain the same, but each scalar value is passed in a single 64-bit
        register rather than a pair of 32-bit registers. For example, scalar
        floating-point values are returned in <b></b><b>$f0</b><b></b> only, not
        a <b></b><b>$f0</b><b></b>/<b></b><b>$f1</b><b></b> pair. The set of
        call-saved registers also remains the same in that the even-numbered
        double-precision registers are saved.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Two additional variants of the o32 ABI are supported to enable
        a transition from 32-bit to 64-bit registers. These are FPXX
        (<b>-mfpxx</b>) and FP64A (<b>-mfp64</b> <b>-mno-odd-spreg</b>). The
        FPXX extension mandates that all code must execute correctly when run
        using 32-bit or 64-bit registers. The code can be interlinked with
        either FP32 or FP64, but not both. The FP64A extension is similar to the
        FP64 extension but forbids the use of odd-numbered single-precision
        registers. This can be used in conjunction with the
        <span class="Li">&quot;FRE&quot;</span> mode of FPUs in MIPS32R5
        processors and allows both FP32 and FP64A code to interlink and run in
        the same process without changing FPU modes.</p>

    <p class="Pp">All <b>-mabicalls</b> code has traditionally been
        position-independent, regardless of options like <b>-fPIC</b> and
        <b>-fpic</b>. However, as an extension, the GNU toolchain allows
        executables to use absolute accesses for locally-binding symbols. It can
        also use shorter GP initialization sequences and generate direct calls
        to locally-defined functions. This mode is selected by
        <b>-mno-shared</b>.</p>
    <p class="Pp"><b>-mno-shared</b> depends on binutils 2.16 or higher and
        generates objects that can only be linked by the GNU linker. However,
        the option does not affect the ABI of the final executable; it only
        affects the ABI of relocatable objects. Using <b>-mno-shared</b>
        generally makes executables both smaller and quicker.</p>

  <dd>Lift (do not lift) the usual restrictions on the size of the global offset

    <p class="Pp">GCC normally uses a single instruction to load values from the
        GOT. While this is relatively efficient, it only works if the GOT is
        smaller than about 64k. Anything larger causes the linker to report an
        error such as:</p>
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        relocation truncated to fit: R_MIPS_GOT16 foobar
    </pre>
    <p class="Pp">If this happens, you should recompile your code with
        <b>-mxgot</b>. This works with very large GOTs, although the code is
        also less efficient, since it takes three instructions to fetch the
        value of a global symbol.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note that some linkers can create multiple GOTs. If you have
        such a linker, you should only need to use <b>-mxgot</b> when a single
        object file accesses more than 64k's worth of GOT entries. Very few
      do.</p>
    <p class="Pp">These options have no effect unless GCC is generating position
        independent code.</p>

  <dt><b>-mr10k-cache-barrier=</b><i>setting</i></dt>
  <dd>Specify whether GCC should insert cache barriers to avoid the side effects
      of speculation on R10K processors.
    <p class="Pp">In common with many processors, the R10K tries to predict the
        outcome of a conditional branch and speculatively executes instructions
        from the &quot;taken&quot; branch. It later aborts these instructions if
        the predicted outcome is wrong. However, on the R10K, even aborted
        instructions can have side effects.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This problem only affects kernel stores and, depending on the
        system, kernel loads. As an example, a speculatively-executed store may
        load the target memory into cache and mark the cache line as dirty, even
        if the store itself is later aborted. If a DMA operation writes to the
        same area of memory before the &quot;dirty&quot; line is flushed, the
        cached data overwrites the DMA-ed data. See the R10K processor manual
        for a full description, including other potential problems.</p>
    <p class="Pp">One workaround is to insert cache barrier instructions before
        every memory access that might be speculatively executed and that might
        have side effects even if aborted.
        <b>-mr10k-cache-barrier=</b><i>setting</i> controls GCC's implementation
        of this workaround. It assumes that aborted accesses to any byte in the
        following regions does not have side effects:</p>
  </dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>

  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>the memory occupied by an object with a link-time-constant address.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">It is the kernel's responsibility to ensure that speculative

<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>

    must allow <span class="Li">&quot;j foo&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;jal foo&quot;</span> to be executed speculatively.

  <dt><b>-masm-hex</b></dt>
  <dd>Force assembly output to always use hex constants. Normally such constants
      are signed decimals, but this option is available for testsuite and/or
      aesthetic purposes.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mmcu=</b></dt>
  <dd>Select the MCU to target. This is used to create a C preprocessor symbol
      based upon the MCU name, converted to upper case and pre- and post-fixed
      with <b>__</b>. This in turn is used by the <i>msp430.h</i> header file to
      select an MCU-specific supplementary header file.
    <p class="Pp">The option also sets the ISA to use. If the MCU name is one
        that is known to only support the 430 ISA then that is selected,
        otherwise the 430X ISA is selected. A generic MCU name of <b>msp430</b>
        can also be used to select the 430 ISA. Similarly the generic
        <b>msp430x</b> MCU name selects the 430X ISA.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In addition an MCU-specific linker script is added to the
        linker command line. The script's name is the name of the MCU with
        <i>.ld</i> appended. Thus specifying <b>-mmcu=xxx</b> on the <b>gcc</b>
        command line defines the C preprocessor symbol
        <span class="Li">&quot;__XXX__&quot;</span> and cause the linker to
        search for a script called <i>xxx.ld</i>.</p>

      <b>-mcpu</b> option and/or the hardware multiply support set by the
      <b>-mhwmult</b> option. It also toggles warnings about unrecognized MCU

      <span class="Li">&quot;size_t&quot;</span>).</dd>
  <dt><b>-mrelax</b></dt>
  <dd>This option is passed to the assembler and linker, and allows the linker
      to perform certain optimizations that cannot be done until the final
    link.</dd>
  <dt><b>mhwmult=</b></dt>
  <dd>Describes the type of hardware multiply supported by the target. Accepted
      values are <b>none</b> for no hardware multiply, <b>16bit</b> for the
      original 16-bit-only multiply supported by early MCUs. <b>32bit</b> for
      the 16/32-bit multiply supported by later MCUs and <b>f5series</b> for the
      16/32-bit multiply supported by F5-series MCUs. A value of <b>auto</b> can
      also be given. This tells GCC to deduce the hardware multiply support
      based upon the MCU name provided by the <b>-mmcu</b> option. If no
      <b>-mmcu</b> option is specified or if the MCU name is not recognized then
      no hardware multiply support is assumed.
      <span class="Li">&quot;auto&quot;</span> is the default setting.
    <p class="Pp">Hardware multiplies are normally performed by calling a
        library routine. This saves space in the generated code. When compiling
        at <b>-O3</b> or higher however the hardware multiplier is invoked
        inline. This makes for bigger, but faster code.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The hardware multiply routines disable interrupts whilst
        running and restore the previous interrupt state when they finish. This
        makes them safe to use inside interrupt handlers as well as in normal
        code.</p>

  <dt><b>-minrt</b></dt>
  <dd>Enable the use of a minimum runtime environment - no static initializers
      or constructors. This is intended for memory-constrained devices. The

  <dt><b>-mcode-region=</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-mdata-region=</b></dt>

      <span class="Li">&quot;either&quot;</span> or

      <span class="Li">&quot;any&quot;</span> - is the default. It leaves
      placement entirely up to the linker script and how it assigns the standard

      <span class="Li">&quot;.data&quot;</span>, etc) to the memory

      contains two parts: the size of integer types and the registers used for

      that <b>long</b> and pointers are 64-bit (implicitly defining <b>int</b>
      to be 32-bit), and that floating-point values up to 64 bits wide are
      passed in F registers. Contrast this with <b>-march=rv64ifd
      -mabi=lp64f</b>, which still allows the compiler to generate code that
      uses the F and D extensions but only allows floating-point values up to 32
      bits long to be passed in registers; or <b>-march=rv64ifd -mabi=lp64</b>,
      in which no floating-point arguments will be passed in registers.
    <p class="Pp">The default for this argument is system dependent, users who

      multiplication and division instructions supported by the RL78/G14 (S3

  <dd>Specifies the RL78 core to target. The default is the G14 core, also known
      as an S3 core or just RL78. The G13 or S2 core does not have multiply or
      divide instructions, instead it uses a hardware peripheral for these
      operations. The G10 or S1 core does not have register banks, so it uses a
      different calling convention.
    <p class="Pp">If this option is set it also selects the type of hardware
        multiply support to use, unless this is overridden by an explicit
        <b>-mmul=none</b> option on the command line. Thus specifying
        <b>-mcpu=g13</b> enables the use of the G13 hardware multiply peripheral
        and specifying <b>-mcpu=g10</b> disables the use of hardware
        multiplications altogether.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Note, although the RL78/G14 core is the default target,
        specifying <b>-mcpu=g14</b> or <b>-mcpu=rl78</b> on the command line
        does change the behavior of the toolchain since it also enables G14
        hardware multiply support. If these options are not specified on the
        command line then software multiplication routines will be used even
        though the code targets the RL78 core. This is for backwards
        compatibility with older toolchains which did not have hardware multiply
        and divide support.</p>

  <dd>You use these options to specify which instructions are available on the
      processor you are using. The default value of these options is determined
      when configuring GCC. Specifying the <b>-mcpu=</b><i>cpu_type</i>
      overrides the specification of these options. We recommend you use the
      <b>-mcpu=</b><i>cpu_type</i> option rather than the options listed above.
    <p class="Pp">Specifying <b>-mpowerpc-gpopt</b> allows GCC to use the
        optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the General Purpose group,
        including floating-point square root. Specifying <b>-mpowerpc-gfxopt</b>
        allows GCC to use the optional PowerPC architecture instructions in the
        Graphics group, including floating-point select.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <b>-mmfcrf</b> option allows GCC to generate the move from
        condition register field instruction implemented on the POWER4 processor
        and other processors that support the PowerPC V2.01 architecture. The

        processors that support the PowerPC V2.06 architecture. The
        <b>-mfprnd</b> option allows GCC to generate the FP round to integer
        instructions implemented on the POWER5+ processor and other processors
        that support the PowerPC V2.03 architecture. The <b>-mcmpb</b> option
        allows GCC to generate the compare bytes instruction implemented on the

    <p class="Pp">The <b>-mpowerpc64</b> option allows GCC to generate the

  <dd>Modify generation of the TOC (Table Of Contents), which is created for

      default. In that case, GCC allocates at least one TOC entry for each

      floating-point constants in the TOC. However, only 16,384 entries are
      available in the TOC.
    <p class="Pp">If you receive a linker error message that saying you have

        space used with the <b>-mno-fp-in-toc</b> and <b>-mno-sum-in-toc</b>

  <dd>Produce code that conforms more closely to IBM XL compiler semantics when

      functions beyond the register save area (RSA) on the stack in addition to
      argument FPRs. Do not assume that most significant double in 128-bit long
      double value is properly rounded when comparing values and converting to
      double. Use XL symbol names for long double support routines.
    <p class="Pp">The AIX calling convention was extended but not initially
        documented to handle an obscure K&amp;R C case of calling a function
        that takes the address of its arguments with fewer arguments than
        declared. IBM XL compilers access floating-point arguments that do not
        fit in the RSA from the stack when a subroutine is compiled without
        optimization. Because always storing floating-point arguments on the
        stack is inefficient and rarely needed, this option is not enabled by
        default and only is necessary when calling subroutines compiled by IBM
        XL compilers without optimization.</p>

  <dd>By default assume that all calls are far away so that a longer and more
      expensive calling sequence is required. This is required for calls farther
      than 32 megabytes (33,554,432 bytes) from the current location. A short
      call is generated if the compiler knows the call cannot be that far away.
      This setting can be overridden by the
      <span class="Li">&quot;shortcall&quot;</span> function attribute, or by
      <span class="Li">&quot;#pragma</span>
      <span class="Li">longcall(0)&quot;</span>.
    <p class="Pp">Some linkers are capable of detecting out-of-range calls and
        generating glue code on the fly. On these systems, long calls are
        unnecessary and generate slower code. As of this writing, the AIX linker
        can do this, as can the GNU linker for PowerPC/64. It is planned to add
        this feature to the GNU linker for 32-bit PowerPC systems as well.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On PowerPC64 ELFv2 and 32-bit PowerPC systems with newer GNU
        linkers, GCC can generate long calls using an inline PLT call sequence
        (see <b>-mpltseq</b>). PowerPC with <b>-mbss-plt</b> and PowerPC64 ELFv1
        (big-endian) do not support inline PLT calls.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On Darwin/PPC systems, <span class="Li">&quot;#pragma
        longcall&quot;</span> generates <span class="Li">&quot;jbsr</span>
        <span class="Li">callee, L42&quot;</span>, plus a <i>branch island</i>
        (glue code). The two target addresses represent the callee and the
        branch island. The Darwin/PPC linker prefers the first address and
        generates a <span class="Li">&quot;bl</span>
        <span class="Li">callee&quot;</span> if the PPC
        <span class="Li">&quot;bl&quot;</span> instruction reaches the callee
        directly; otherwise, the linker generates <span class="Li">&quot;bl
        L42&quot;</span> to call the branch island. The branch island is
        appended to the body of the calling function; it computes the full
        32-bit address of the callee and jumps to it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">On Mach-O (Darwin) systems, this option directs the compiler
        emit to the glue for every direct call, and the Darwin linker decides
        whether to use or discard it.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In the future, GCC may ignore all longcall specifications when
        the linker is known to generate glue.</p>

      this area, so it is no longer available for use by the compiler. This

    <p class="Pp">Note, common variables (variables that have not been

  <dt><b>-mmax-constant-size=</b><i>N</i></dt>
  <dd>Specifies the maximum size, in bytes, of a constant that can be used as an
      operand in a RX instruction. Although the RX instruction set does allow
      constants of up to 4 bytes in length to be used in instructions, a longer
      value equates to a longer instruction. Thus in some circumstances it can

      not reserve any registers.</dd>
  <dt><b>-msave-acc-in-interrupts</b></dt>
  <dd>Specifies that interrupt handler functions should preserve the accumulator
      register. This is only necessary if normal code might use the accumulator
      register, for example because it performs 64-bit multiplications. The

      faster.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mpid</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-mno-pid</b></dt>
  <dd>Enables the generation of position independent data. When enabled any
      access to constant data is done via an offset from a base address held in
      a register. This allows the location of constant data to be determined at
      run time without requiring the executable to be relocated, which is a
      benefit to embedded applications with tight memory constraints. Data that
      can be modified is not affected by this option.
    <p class="Pp">Note, using this feature reserves a register, usually

      may prefetch data, which is not safe to do if accessing an I/O register.
      (See section 12.2.7 of the RX62N Group User's Manual for more
      information).
    <p class="Pp">The default is to allow these instructions, but it is not
        possible for GCC to reliably detect all circumstances where a string
        instruction might be used to access an I/O register, so their use cannot
        be disabled automatically. Instead it is reliant upon the programmer to
        use the <b>-mno-allow-string-insns</b> option if their program accesses
        I/O space.</p>
    <p class="Pp">When the instructions are enabled GCC defines the C

        it defines the symbol

      When <b>-mno-packed-stack</b> is in effect, the backchain pointer is
      stored at the bottom of the stack frame; when <b>-mpacked-stack</b> is in

      are densely packed at the top of the register save area; unused space is
      reused for other purposes, allowing for more efficient use of the

      This model is compatible with the regular register window model. The local

      <b>Warning:</b> the requisite libraries are not available for all SPARC

      your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
      cross-compilation. The embedded targets <b>sparc-*-aout</b> and
      <b>sparclite-*-*</b> do provide software floating-point support.
    <p class="Pp"><b>-msoft-float</b> changes the calling convention in the

    <p class="Pp">As of this writing, there are no SPARC implementations that
        have hardware support for the quad-word floating-point instructions.
        They all invoke a trap handler for one of these instructions, and then
        the trap handler emulates the effect of the instruction. Because of the

        8-byte alignment only if they are contained in another type, or if they
        have an absolute address. Otherwise, it assumes they have 4-byte
        alignment. Specifying this option avoids some rare compatibility
        problems with code generated by other compilers. It is not the default

  <dd>Instructions that initiate or test completion of DMA must not be reordered

      With <b>-munsafe-dma</b> you must use the
      <span class="Li">&quot;volatile&quot;</span> keyword to protect memory

      is known to not change. Rather than mark the memory as volatile, you can
      use <b>-msafe-dma</b> to tell the compiler to treat the DMA instructions
      as potentially affecting all memory.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mbranch-hints</b></dt>
  <dd>By default, GCC generates a branch hint instruction to avoid pipeline
      stalls for always-taken or probably-taken branches. A hint is not
      generated closer than 8 instructions away from its branch. There is little

      the <span class="Li">&quot;__ea&quot;</span> named address space qualifier
      are either 32 or 64 bits wide. The default is 32 bits. As this is an

      with the same setting.</dd>
  <dt><b>-maddress-space-conversion</b></dt>

  <dt><b>-mno-address-space-conversion</b></dt>
  <dd>Allow/disallow treating the <span class="Li">&quot;__ea&quot;</span>

  <dt><b>-mcache-size=</b><i>cache-size</i></dt>

  <dd>This option controls the version of libgcc that the compiler links to an

      to a PPU variable from SPU code using the
      <span class="Li">&quot;__ea&quot;</span> named address space qualifier do
      not interfere with changes to other PPU variables residing in the same
      cache line from PPU code. If you do not use atomic updates, such
      interference may occur; however, writing back cache lines is more
      efficient. The default behavior is to use atomic updates.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mdual-nops</b></dt>

  <dt><b>-mdual-nops=</b><i>n</i></dt>
  <dd>By default, GCC inserts NOPs to increase dual issue when it expects it to

  <dt><b>-mhint-max-nops=</b><i>n</i></dt>
  <dd>Maximum number of NOPs to insert for a branch hint. A branch hint must be

      up to <i>n</i> NOPs to enforce this, otherwise it does not generate the
      branch hint.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mhint-max-distance=</b><i>n</i></dt>
  <dd>The encoding of the branch hint instruction limits the hint to be within

  <dt><b>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=</b><i>num</i></dt>
  <dd>Attempt to keep the stack boundary aligned to a 2 raised to <i>num</i>
      byte boundary. If <b>-mpreferred-stack-boundary</b> is not specified, the
      default is 4 (16 bytes or 128 bits).
    <p class="Pp"><b>Warning:</b> When generating code for the x86-64
        architecture with SSE extensions disabled,
        <b>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3</b> can be used to keep the stack
        boundary aligned to 8 byte boundary. Since x86-64 ABI require 16 byte
        stack alignment, this is ABI incompatible and intended to be used in
        controlled environment where stack space is important limitation. This
        option leads to wrong code when functions compiled with 16 byte stack
        alignment (such as functions from a standard library) are called with
        misaligned stack. In this case, SSE instructions may lead to misaligned
        memory access traps. In addition, variable arguments are handled
        incorrectly for 16 byte aligned objects (including x87 long double and
        __int128), leading to wrong results. You must build all modules with
        <b>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=3</b>, including any libraries. This
        includes the system libraries and startup modules.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>-mincoming-stack-boundary=</b><i>num</i></dt>
  <dd>Assume the incoming stack is aligned to a 2 raised to <i>num</i> byte
      boundary. If <b>-mincoming-stack-boundary</b> is not specified, the one
      specified by <b>-mpreferred-stack-boundary</b> is used.
    <p class="Pp">On Pentium and Pentium Pro,
        <span class="Li">&quot;double&quot;</span> and
        <span class="Li">&quot;long double&quot;</span> values should be aligned
        to an 8-byte boundary (see <b>-malign-double</b>) or suffer significant
        run time performance penalties. On Pentium III, the Streaming SIMD
        Extension (SSE) data type <span class="Li">&quot;__m128&quot;</span> may
        not work properly if it is not 16-byte aligned.</p>
    <p class="Pp">To ensure proper alignment of this values on the stack, the
        stack boundary must be as aligned as that required by any value stored
        on the stack. Further, every function must be generated such that it
        keeps the stack aligned. Thus calling a function compiled with a higher
        preferred stack boundary from a function compiled with a lower preferred
        stack boundary most likely misaligns the stack. It is recommended that
        libraries that use callbacks always use the default setting.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This extra alignment does consume extra stack space, and
        generally increases code size. Code that is sensitive to stack space
        usage, such as embedded systems and operating system kernels, may want
        to reduce the preferred alignment to
        <b>-mpreferred-stack-boundary=2</b>.</p>

        lays out the structure differently than the way GCC normally does.
        Particularly when moving packed data between functions compiled with GCC
        and the native Microsoft compiler (either via function call or as data

    <p class="Pp">The Microsoft structure layout algorithm is fairly simple with
        the exception of the bit-field packing. The padding and alignment of
        members of structures and whether a bit-field can straddle a

</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1. Structure members are stored sequentially in the order in which they
    are</dt>
  <dd>declared: the first member has the lowest memory address and the last
      member the highest.</dd>
  <dt>2. Every data object has an alignment requirement. The alignment
    requirement</dt>
  <dd>for all data except structures, unions, and arrays is either the size of
      the object or the current packing size (specified with either the
      <span class="Li">&quot;aligned&quot;</span> attribute or the
      <span class="Li">&quot;pack&quot;</span> pragma), whichever is less. For
      structures, unions, and arrays, the alignment requirement is the largest
      alignment requirement of its members. Every object is allocated an offset
      so that:
    <p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
    <pre>
        offset % alignment_requirement == 0
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt>3. Adjacent bit-fields are packed into the same 1-, 2-, or 4-byte

<p class="Pp"><i>x86 Windows Options</i></p>
<p class="Pp">These additional options are available for Microsoft Windows
    targets:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-mconsole</b></dt>
  <dd>This option specifies that a console application is to be generated, by
      instructing the linker to set the PE header subsystem type required for
      console applications. This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW
      targets and is enabled by default on those targets.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mdll</b></dt>
  <dd>This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets. It specifies that a
      DLL---a dynamic link library---is to be generated, enabling the selection
      of the required runtime startup object and entry point.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mnop-fun-dllimport</b></dt>
  <dd>This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets. It specifies that
      the <span class="Li">&quot;dllimport&quot;</span> attribute should be
      ignored.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mthread</b></dt>
  <dd>This option is available for MinGW targets. It specifies that
      MinGW-specific thread support is to be used.</dd>
  <dt><b>-municode</b></dt>
  <dd>This option is available for MinGW-w64 targets. It causes the
      <span class="Li">&quot;UNICODE&quot;</span> preprocessor macro to be
      predefined, and chooses Unicode-capable runtime startup code.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mwin32</b></dt>
  <dd>This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets. It specifies that
      the typical Microsoft Windows predefined macros are to be set in the
      pre-processor, but does not influence the choice of runtime
      library/startup code.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mwindows</b></dt>
  <dd>This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets. It specifies that a
      GUI application is to be generated by instructing the linker to set the PE
      header subsystem type appropriately.</dd>
  <dt><b>-fno-set-stack-executable</b></dt>
  <dd>This option is available for MinGW targets. It specifies that the
      executable flag for the stack used by nested functions isn't set. This is
      necessary for binaries running in kernel mode of Microsoft Windows, as
      there the User32 API, which is used to set executable privileges, isn't
      available.</dd>
  <dt><b>-fwritable-relocated-rdata</b></dt>
  <dd>This option is available for MinGW and Cygwin targets. It specifies that
      relocated-data in read-only section is put into the
      <span class="Li">&quot;.data&quot;</span> section. This is a necessary for
      older runtimes not supporting modification of
      <span class="Li">&quot;.rdata&quot;</span> sections for
    pseudo-relocation.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mpe-aligned-commons</b></dt>
  <dd>This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets. It specifies that
      the GNU extension to the PE file format that permits the correct alignment
      of COMMON variables should be used when generating code. It is enabled by
      default if GCC detects that the target assembler found during
      configuration supports the feature.</dd>

</dl>
<p class="Pp"><i>Xtensa Options</i></p>
<p class="Pp">These options are supported for Xtensa targets:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>-mconst16</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-mno-const16</b></dt>
  <dd>Enable or disable use of <span class="Li">&quot;CONST16&quot;</span>
      instructions for loading constant values. The
      <span class="Li">&quot;CONST16&quot;</span> instruction is currently not a
      standard option from Tensilica. When enabled,
      <span class="Li">&quot;CONST16&quot;</span> instructions are always used
      in place of the standard <span class="Li">&quot;L32R&quot;</span>
      instructions. The use of <span class="Li">&quot;CONST16&quot;</span> is
      enabled by default only if the <span class="Li">&quot;L32R&quot;</span>
      instruction is not available.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mfused-madd</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-mno-fused-madd</b></dt>
  <dd>Enable or disable use of fused multiply/add and multiply/subtract
      instructions in the floating-point option. This has no effect if the
      floating-point option is not also enabled. Disabling fused multiply/add
      and multiply/subtract instructions forces the compiler to use separate
      instructions for the multiply and add/subtract operations. This may be
      desirable in some cases where strict IEEE 754-compliant results are
      required: the fused multiply add/subtract instructions do not round the
      intermediate result, thereby producing results with <i>more</i> bits of
      precision than specified by the IEEE standard. Disabling fused multiply
      add/subtract instructions also ensures that the program output is not
      sensitive to the compiler's ability to combine multiply and add/subtract
      operations.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mserialize-volatile</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-mno-serialize-volatile</b></dt>
  <dd>When this option is enabled, GCC inserts
      <span class="Li">&quot;MEMW&quot;</span> instructions before
      <span class="Li">&quot;volatile&quot;</span> memory references to
      guarantee sequential consistency. The default is
      <b>-mserialize-volatile</b>. Use <b>-mno-serialize-volatile</b> to omit
      the <span class="Li">&quot;MEMW&quot;</span> instructions.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mforce-no-pic</b></dt>
  <dd>For targets, like GNU/Linux, where all user-mode Xtensa code must be
      position-independent code (PIC), this option disables PIC for compiling
      kernel code.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mtext-section-literals</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-mno-text-section-literals</b></dt>
  <dd>These options control the treatment of literal pools. The default is
      <b>-mno-text-section-literals</b>, which places literals in a separate
      section in the output file. This allows the literal pool to be placed in a
      data RAM/ROM, and it also allows the linker to combine literal pools from
      separate object files to remove redundant literals and improve code size.
      With <b>-mtext-section-literals</b>, the literals are interspersed in the
      text section in order to keep them as close as possible to their
      references. This may be necessary for large assembly files. Literals for
      each function are placed right before that function.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mauto-litpools</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-mno-auto-litpools</b></dt>
  <dd>These options control the treatment of literal pools. The default is
      <b>-mno-auto-litpools</b>, which places literals in a separate section in
      the output file unless <b>-mtext-section-literals</b> is used. With
      <b>-mauto-litpools</b> the literals are interspersed in the text section
      by the assembler. Compiler does not produce explicit
      <span class="Li">&quot;.literal&quot;</span> directives and loads literals
      into registers with <span class="Li">&quot;MOVI&quot;</span> instructions
      instead of <span class="Li">&quot;L32R&quot;</span> to let the assembler
      do relaxation and place literals as necessary. This option allows
      assembler to create several literal pools per function and assemble very
      big functions, which may not be possible with
      <b>-mtext-section-literals</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mtarget-align</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-mno-target-align</b></dt>
  <dd>When this option is enabled, GCC instructs the assembler to automatically
      align instructions to reduce branch penalties at the expense of some code
      density. The assembler attempts to widen density instructions to align
      branch targets and the instructions following call instructions. If there
      are not enough preceding safe density instructions to align a target, no
      widening is performed. The default is <b>-mtarget-align</b>. These options
      do not affect the treatment of auto-aligned instructions like
      <span class="Li">&quot;LOOP&quot;</span>, which the assembler always
      aligns, either by widening density instructions or by inserting NOP
      instructions.</dd>
  <dt><b>-mlongcalls</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>-mno-longcalls</b></dt>
  <dd>When this option is enabled, GCC instructs the assembler to translate
      direct calls to indirect calls unless it can determine that the target of
      a direct call is in the range allowed by the call instruction. This
      translation typically occurs for calls to functions in other source files.
      Specifically, the assembler translates a direct
      <span class="Li">&quot;CALL&quot;</span> instruction into an
      <span class="Li">&quot;L32R&quot;</span> followed by a
      <span class="Li">&quot;CALLX&quot;</span> instruction. The default is
      <b>-mno-longcalls</b>. This option should be used in programs where the
      call target can potentially be out of range. This option is implemented in
      the assembler, not the compiler, so the assembly code generated by GCC
      still shows direct call instructions---look at the disassembled object
      code to see the actual instructions. Note that the assembler uses an
      indirect call for every cross-file call, not just those that really are
      out of range.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"><i>zSeries Options</i></p>
<p class="Pp">These are listed under</p>
</section>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="permalink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
This section describes several environment variables that affect how GCC
  operates. Some of them work by specifying directories or prefixes to use when
  searching for various kinds of files. Some are used to specify other aspects
  of the compilation environment.
<p class="Pp">Note that you can also specify places to search using options such
    as <b>-B</b>, <b>-I</b> and <b>-L</b>. These take precedence over places
    specified using environment variables, which in turn take precedence over
    those specified by the configuration of GCC.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>LANG</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>LC_CTYPE</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>LC_MESSAGES</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>LC_ALL</b></dt>
  <dd>These environment variables control the way that GCC uses localization
      information which allows GCC to work with different national conventions.
      GCC inspects the locale categories <b>LC_CTYPE</b> and <b>LC_MESSAGES</b>
      if it has been configured to do so. These locale categories can be set to
      any value supported by your installation. A typical value is
      <b>en_GB.UTF-8</b> for English in the United Kingdom encoded in UTF-8.
    <p class="Pp">The <b>LC_CTYPE</b> environment variable specifies character
        classification. GCC uses it to determine the character boundaries in a
        string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that contain quote
        and escape characters that are otherwise interpreted as a string end or
        escape.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The <b>LC_MESSAGES</b> environment variable specifies the
        language to use in diagnostic messages.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If the <b>LC_ALL</b> environment variable is set, it overrides
        the value of <b>LC_CTYPE</b> and <b>LC_MESSAGES</b>; otherwise,
        <b>LC_CTYPE</b> and <b>LC_MESSAGES</b> default to the value of the
        <b>LANG</b> environment variable. If none of these variables are set,
        GCC defaults to traditional C English behavior.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>TMPDIR</b></dt>
  <dd>If <b>TMPDIR</b> is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary
      files. GCC uses temporary files to hold the output of one stage of
      compilation which is to be used as input to the next stage: for example,
      the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler
    proper.</dd>
  <dt><b>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</b></dt>
  <dd>Setting <b>GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG</b> is nearly equivalent to passing
      <b>-fcompare-debug</b> to the compiler driver. See the documentation of
      this option for more details.</dd>
  <dt><b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b></dt>
  <dd>If <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b> is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the
      names of the subprograms executed by the compiler. No slash is added when
      this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram, but you can specify
      a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.
    <p class="Pp">If <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b> is not set, GCC attempts to figure
        out an appropriate prefix to use based on the pathname it is invoked
        with.</p>
    <p class="Pp">If GCC cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix,
        it tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The default value of <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b> is
        <i></i><i>prefix</i><i>/lib/gcc/</i> where <i>prefix</i> is the prefix
        to the installed compiler. In many cases <i>prefix</i> is the value of
        <span class="Li">&quot;prefix&quot;</span> when you ran the
        <i>configure</i> script.</p>
    <p class="Pp">Other prefixes specified with <b>-B</b> take precedence over
        this prefix.</p>
    <p class="Pp">This prefix is also used for finding files such as
        <i>crt0.o</i> that are used for linking.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding
        the directories to search for header files. For each of the standard
        directories whose name normally begins with <b>/usr/local/lib/gcc</b>
        (more precisely, with the value of <b>GCC_INCLUDE_DIR</b>), GCC tries
        replacing that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an
        alternate directory name. Thus, with <b>-Bfoo/</b>, GCC searches
        <i>foo/bar</i> just before it searches the standard directory
        <i>/usr/local/lib/bar</i>. If a standard directory begins with the
        configured <i>prefix</i> then the value of <i>prefix</i> is replaced by
        <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b> when looking for header files.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>COMPILER_PATH</b></dt>
  <dd>The value of <b>COMPILER_PATH</b> is a colon-separated list of
      directories, much like <b>PATH</b>. GCC tries the directories thus
      specified when searching for subprograms, if it cannot find the
      subprograms using <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b>.</dd>
  <dt><b>LIBRARY_PATH</b></dt>
  <dd>The value of <b>LIBRARY_PATH</b> is a colon-separated list of directories,
      much like <b>PATH</b>. When configured as a native compiler, GCC tries the
      directories thus specified when searching for special linker files, if it
      cannot find them using <b>GCC_EXEC_PREFIX</b>. Linking using GCC also uses
      these directories when searching for ordinary libraries for the <b>-l</b>
      option (but directories specified with <b>-L</b> come first).</dd>
  <dt><b>LANG</b></dt>
  <dd>This variable is used to pass locale information to the compiler. One way
      in which this information is used is to determine the character set to be
      used when character literals, string literals and comments are parsed in C
      and C++. When the compiler is configured to allow multibyte characters,
      the following values for <b>LANG</b> are recognized:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>C-JIS</b></dt>
  <dd>Recognize JIS characters.</dd>
  <dt><b>C-SJIS</b></dt>
  <dd>Recognize SJIS characters.</dd>
  <dt><b>C-EUCJP</b></dt>
  <dd>Recognize EUCJP characters.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<p class="Pp">If <b>LANG</b> is not defined, or if it has some other value, then
    the compiler uses <span class="Li">&quot;mblen&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;mbtowc&quot;</span> as defined by the default locale
    to recognize and translate multibyte characters.</p>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Some additional environment variables affect the behavior of the
    preprocessor.</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>CPATH</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>C_INCLUDE_PATH</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH</b></dt>
  <dd>Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a special
      character, much like <b>PATH</b>, in which to look for header files. The
      special character, <span class="Li">&quot;PATH_SEPARATOR&quot;</span>, is
      target-dependent and determined at GCC build time. For Microsoft
      Windows-based targets it is a semicolon, and for almost all other targets
      it is a colon.
    <p class="Pp"><b>CPATH</b> specifies a list of directories to be searched as
        if specified with <b>-I</b>, but after any paths given with <b>-I</b>
        options on the command line. This environment variable is used
        regardless of which language is being preprocessed.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The remaining environment variables apply only when
        preprocessing the particular language indicated. Each specifies a list
        of directories to be searched as if specified with <b>-isystem</b>, but
        after any paths given with <b>-isystem</b> options on the command
      line.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In all these variables, an empty element instructs the
        compiler to search its current working directory. Empty elements can
        appear at the beginning or end of a path. For instance, if the value of
        <b>CPATH</b> is <span class="Li">&quot;:/special/include&quot;</span>,
        that has the same effect as <b>-I.&#x00A0;-I/special/include</b>.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b></dt>
  <dd>If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output dependencies
      for Make based on the non-system header files processed by the compiler.
      System header files are ignored in the dependency output.
    <p class="Pp">The value of <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b> can be just a file
        name, in which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing
        the target name from the source file name. Or the value can have the
        form <i>file</i><b> </b><i>target</i>, in which case the rules are
        written to file <i>file</i> using <i>target</i> as the target name.</p>
    <p class="Pp">In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to
        combining the options <b>-MM</b> and <b>-MF</b>, with an optional
        <b>-MT</b> switch too.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><b>SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES</b></dt>
  <dd>This variable is the same as <b>DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT</b> (see above),
      except that system header files are not ignored, so it implies <b>-M</b>
      rather than <b>-MM</b>. However, the dependence on the main input file is
      omitted.</dd>
  <dt><b>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</b></dt>
  <dd>If this variable is set, its value specifies a UNIX timestamp to be used
      in replacement of the current date and time in the
      <span class="Li">&quot;__DATE__&quot;</span> and
      <span class="Li">&quot;__TIME__&quot;</span> macros, so that the embedded
      timestamps become reproducible.
    <p class="Pp">The value of <b>SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH</b> must be a UNIX
        timestamp, defined as the number of seconds (excluding leap seconds)
        since 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 represented in ASCII; identical to the output
        of <b></b><b>@command</b><b>{date +%s</b>} on GNU/Linux and other
        systems that support the <span class="Li">%s</span> extension in the
        <span class="Li">&quot;date&quot;</span> command.</p>
    <p class="Pp">The value should be a known timestamp such as the last
        modification time of the source or package and it should be set by the
        build process.</p>
