<b>gcov</b> is a test coverage program. Use it in concert with GCC to analyze
  your programs to help create more efficient, faster running code and to
  discover untested parts of your program. You can use <b>gcov</b> as a
  profiling tool to help discover where your optimization efforts will best
  affect your code. You can also use <b>gcov</b> along with the other profiling
  tool, <b>gprof</b>, to assess which parts of your code use the greatest amount
  of computing time.
<p class="Pp">Profiling tools help you analyze your code's performance. Using a
    profiler such as <b>gcov</b> or <b>gprof</b>, you can find out some basic
    performance statistics, such as:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>how often each line of code executes</li>
  <li>what lines of code are actually executed</li>
  <li>how much computing time each section of code uses</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Once you know these things about how your code works when
    compiled, you can look at each module to see which modules should be
    optimized. <b>gcov</b> helps you determine where to work on
  optimization.</p>
<p class="Pp">Software developers also use coverage testing in concert with
    testsuites, to make sure software is actually good enough for a release.
    Testsuites can verify that a program works as expected; a coverage program
    tests to see how much of the program is exercised by the testsuite.
    Developers can then determine what kinds of test cases need to be added to
    the testsuites to create both better testing and a better final product.</p>
<p class="Pp">You should compile your code without optimization if you plan to
    use <b>gcov</b> because the optimization, by combining some lines of code
    into one function, may not give you as much information as you need to look
    for `hot spots' where the code is using a great deal of computer time.
    Likewise, because <b>gcov</b> accumulates statistics by line (at the lowest
    resolution), it works best with a programming style that places only one
    statement on each line. If you use complicated macros that expand to loops
    or to other control structures, the statistics are less helpful---they only
    report on the line where the macro call appears. If your complex macros
    behave like functions, you can replace them with inline functions to solve
    this problem.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>gcov</b> creates a logfile called
    <i></i><i>sourcefile</i><i>.gcov</i> which indicates how many times each
    line of a source file <i></i><i>sourcefile</i><i>.c</i> has executed. You
    can use these logfiles along with <b>gprof</b> to aid in fine-tuning the
    performance of your programs. <b>gprof</b> gives timing information you can
    use along with the information you get from <b>gcov</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>gcov</b> works only on code compiled with GCC. It is not
    compatible with any other profiling or test coverage mechanism.</p>

  <dt><b>--branch-probabilities</b></dt>
  <dd>Write branch frequencies to the output file, and write branch summary info
      to the standard output. This option allows you to see how often each
      branch in your program was taken. Unconditional branches will not be
      shown, unless the <b>-u</b> option is given.</dd>

  <dd>Write counts in human readable format (like 24.6k).</dd>
  <dt><b>-k</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--use-colors</b></dt>
  <dd>Use colors for lines of code that have zero coverage. We use red color for
      non-exceptional lines and cyan for exceptional. Same colors are used for
      basic blocks with <b>-a</b> option.</dd>
  <dt><b>-l</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--long-file-names</b></dt>
  <dd>Create long file names for included source files. For example, if the
      header file <i>x.h</i> contains code, and was included in the file
      <i>a.c</i>, then running <b>gcov</b> on the file <i>a.c</i> will produce
      an output file called <i>a.c##x.h.gcov</i> instead of <i>x.h.gcov</i>.
      This can be useful if <i>x.h</i> is included in multiple source files and
      you want to see the individual contributions. If you use the <b>-p</b>
      option, both the including and included file names will be complete path
      names.</dd>
  <dt><b>-m</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--demangled-names</b></dt>

  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--object-directory</b> <i>directory</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--object-file</b> <i>file</i></dt>
  <dd>Specify either the directory containing the gcov data files, or the object
      path name. The <i>.gcno</i>, and <i>.gcda</i> data files are searched for
      using this option. If a directory is specified, the data files are in that
      directory and named after the input file name, without its extension. If a
      file is specified here, the data files are named after that file, without
      its extension.</dd>
  <dt><b>-p</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--preserve-paths</b></dt>
  <dd>Preserve complete path information in the names of generated <i>.gcov</i>
      files. Without this option, just the filename component is used. With this
      option, all directories are used, with <b>/</b> characters translated to
      <b>#</b> characters, <i>.</i> directory components removed and
      unremoveable <i>..</i> components renamed to <b>^</b>. This is useful if
      sourcefiles are in several different directories.</dd>
  <dt><b>-q</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--use-hotness-colors</b></dt>
  <dd>Emit perf-like colored output for hot lines. Legend of the color scale is
      printed at the very beginning of the output file.</dd>
  <dt><b>-r</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--relative-only</b></dt>
  <dd>Only output information about source files with a relative pathname (after
      source prefix elision). Absolute paths are usually system header files and
      coverage of any inline functions therein is normally uninteresting.</dd>
  <dt><b>-s</b> <i>directory</i></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--source-prefix</b> <i>directory</i></dt>
  <dd>A prefix for source file names to remove when generating the output
      coverage files. This option is useful when building in a separate
      directory, and the pathname to the source directory is not wanted when
      determining the output file names. Note that this prefix detection is
      applied before determining whether the source file is absolute.</dd>

  <dd>Output to standard output instead of output files.</dd>
  <dt><b>-u</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--unconditional-branches</b></dt>
  <dd>When branch probabilities are given, include those of unconditional
      branches. Unconditional branches are normally not interesting.</dd>
  <dt><b>-v</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--version</b></dt>
  <dd>Display the <b>gcov</b> version number (on the standard output), and exit
      without doing any further processing.</dd>

  <dd>Print verbose informations related to basic blocks and arcs.</dd>
  <dt><b>-x</b></dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt><b>--hash-filenames</b></dt>
  <dd>When using <i>--preserve-paths</i>, gcov uses the full pathname of the
      source files to create an output filename. This can lead to long filenames
      that can overflow filesystem limits. This option creates names of the form
      <i></i><i>source-file</i><i>##</i><i>md5</i><i>.gcov</i>, where the
      <i>source-file</i> component is the final filename part and the <i>md5</i>
      component is calculated from the full mangled name that would have been
      used otherwise. The option is an alternative to the
      <i>--preserve-paths</i> on systems which have a filesystem limit.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp"><b>gcov</b> should be run with the current directory the same as
    that when you invoked the compiler. Otherwise it will not be able to locate
    the source files. <b>gcov</b> produces files called
    <i></i><i>mangledname</i> <i>.gcov</i> in the current directory. These
    contain the coverage information of the source file they correspond to. One
    <i>.gcov</i> file is produced for each source (or header) file containing
    code, which was compiled to produce the data files. The <i>mangledname</i>
    part of the output file name is usually simply the source file name, but can
    be something more complicated if the <b>-l</b> or <b>-p</b> options are
    given. Refer to those options for details.</p>
<p class="Pp">If you invoke <b>gcov</b> with multiple input files, the
    contributions from each input file are summed. Typically you would invoke it
    with the same list of files as the final link of your executable.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>.gcov</i> files contain the <b>:</b> separated fields along
    with program source code. The format is</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        &lt;execution_count&gt;:&lt;line_number&gt;:&lt;source line text&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">Additional block information may succeed each line, when requested
    by command line option. The <i>execution_count</i> is <b>-</b> for lines
    containing no code. Unexecuted lines are marked <b>#####</b> or
    <b>=====</b>, depending on whether they are reachable by non-exceptional
    paths or only exceptional paths such as C++ exception handlers,
    respectively. Given the <b>-a</b> option, unexecuted blocks are marked
    <b>$$$$$</b> or <b>%%%%%</b>, depending on whether a basic block is
    reachable via non-exceptional or exceptional paths. Executed basic blocks
    having a statement with zero <i>execution_count</i> end with <b>*</b>
    character and are colored with magenta color with the <b>-k</b> option. This
    functionality is not supported in Ada.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that GCC can completely remove the bodies of functions that
    are not needed -- for instance if they are inlined everywhere. Such
    functions are marked with <b>-</b>, which can be confusing. Use the
    <b>-fkeep-inline-functions</b> and <b>-fkeep-static-functions</b> options to
    retain these functions and allow gcov to properly show their
    <i>execution_count</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some lines of information at the start have <i>line_number</i> of
    zero. These preamble lines are of the form</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        -:0:&lt;tag&gt;:&lt;value&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The ordering and number of these preamble lines will be augmented
    as <b>gcov</b> development progresses --- do not rely on them remaining
    unchanged. Use <i>tag</i> to locate a particular preamble line.</p>
<p class="Pp">The additional block information is of the form</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        &lt;tag&gt; &lt;information&gt;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The <i>information</i> is human readable, but designed to be
    simple enough for machine parsing too.</p>
<p class="Pp">When printing percentages, 0% and 100% are only printed when the
    values are <i>exactly</i> 0% and 100% respectively. Other values which would
    conventionally be rounded to 0% or 100% are instead printed as the nearest
    non-boundary value.</p>
<p class="Pp">When using <b>gcov</b>, you must first compile your program with a
    special GCC option <b>--coverage</b>. This tells the compiler to generate
    additional information needed by gcov (basically a flow graph of the
    program) and also includes additional code in the object files for
    generating the extra profiling information needed by gcov. These additional
    files are placed in the directory where the object file is located.</p>
<p class="Pp">Running the program will cause profile output to be generated. For
    each source file compiled with <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>, an accompanying
    <i>.gcda</i> file will be placed in the object file directory.</p>
<p class="Pp">Running <b>gcov</b> with your program's source file names as
    arguments will now produce a listing of the code along with frequency of
    execution for each line. For example, if your program is called
    <i>tmp.cpp</i>, this is what you see when you use the basic <b>gcov</b>
    facility:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        $ g++ --coverage tmp.cpp
        $ a.out
        $ gcov tmp.cpp -m
        File 'tmp.cpp'
        Lines executed:92.86% of 14
        Creating 'tmp.cpp.gcov'
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The file <i>tmp.cpp.gcov</i> contains output from <b>gcov</b>.
    Here is a sample:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>

<p class="Pp">For each function, a line is printed showing how many times the
    function is called, how many times it returns and what percentage of the
    function's blocks were executed.</p>
<p class="Pp">For each basic block, a line is printed after the last line of the
    basic block describing the branch or call that ends the basic block. There
    can be multiple branches and calls listed for a single source line if there
    are multiple basic blocks that end on that line. In this case, the branches
    and calls are each given a number. There is no simple way to map these
    branches and calls back to source constructs. In general, though, the lowest
    numbered branch or call will correspond to the leftmost construct on the
    source line.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a branch, if it was executed at least once, then a percentage
    indicating the number of times the branch was taken divided by the number of
    times the branch was executed will be printed. Otherwise, the message
    &quot;never executed&quot; is printed.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a call, if it was executed at least once, then a percentage
    indicating the number of times the call returned divided by the number of
    times the call was executed will be printed. This will usually be 100%, but
    may be less for functions that call <span class="Li">&quot;exit&quot;</span>
    or <span class="Li">&quot;longjmp&quot;</span>, and thus may not return
    every time they are called.</p>
<p class="Pp">The execution counts are cumulative. If the example program were
    executed again without removing the <i>.gcda</i> file, the count for the
    number of times each line in the source was executed would be added to the
    results of the previous run(s). This is potentially useful in several ways.
    For example, it could be used to accumulate data over a number of program
    runs as part of a test verification suite, or to provide more accurate
    long-term information over a large number of program runs.</p>
<p class="Pp">The data in the <i>.gcda</i> files is saved immediately before the
    program exits. For each source file compiled with <b>-fprofile-arcs</b>, the
    profiling code first attempts to read in an existing <i>.gcda</i> file; if
    the file doesn't match the executable (differing number of basic block
    counts) it will ignore the contents of the file. It then adds in the new
    execution counts and finally writes the data to the file.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Using__fBgcov_fP_with__s-1GCC_s0_Optimization"><a class="permalink" href="#Using__fBgcov_fP_with__s-1GCC_s0_Optimization">Using
  <b>gcov</b> with GCC Optimization</a></h2>
If you plan to use <b>gcov</b> to help optimize your code, you must first
  compile your program with a special GCC option <b>--coverage</b>. Aside from
  that, you can use any other GCC options; but if you want to prove that every
  single line in your program was executed, you should not compile with
  optimization at the same time. On some machines the optimizer can eliminate
  some simple code lines by combining them with other lines. For example, code
  like this:
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
        if (a != b)
          c = 1;
        else
          c = 0;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">can be compiled into one instruction on some machines. In this
    case, there is no way for <b>gcov</b> to calculate separate execution counts
    for each line because there isn't separate code for each line. Hence the
    <b>gcov</b> output looks like this if you compiled the program with
    optimization:</p>
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li"></span></p>
<pre>
              100:   12:if (a != b)
              100:   13:  c = 1;
              100:   14:else
              100:   15:  c = 0;
</pre>
<p class="Pp">The output shows that this block of code, combined by
    optimization, executed 100 times. In one sense this result is correct,
    because there was only one instruction representing all four of these lines.
    However, the output does not indicate how many times the result was 0 and
    how many times the result was 1.</p>
<p class="Pp">Inlineable functions can create unexpected line counts. Line
    counts are shown for the source code of the inlineable function, but what is
    shown depends on where the function is inlined, or if it is not inlined at
    all.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the function is not inlined, the compiler must emit an out of
    line copy of the function, in any object file that needs it. If
    <i>fileA.o</i> and <i>fileB.o</i> both contain out of line bodies of a
    particular inlineable function, they will also both contain coverage counts
    for that function. When <i>fileA.o</i> and <i>fileB.o</i> are linked
    together, the linker will, on many systems, select one of those out of line
    bodies for all calls to that function, and remove or ignore the other.
    Unfortunately, it will not remove the coverage counters for the unused
    function body. Hence when instrumented, all but one use of that function
    will show zero counts.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the function is inlined in several places, the block structure
    in each location might not be the same. For instance, a condition might now
    be calculable at compile time in some instances. Because the coverage of all
    the uses of the inline function will be shown for the same source lines, the
    line counts themselves might seem inconsistent.</p>
<p class="Pp">Long-running applications can use the
    <span class="Li">&quot;__gcov_reset&quot;</span> and
    <span class="Li">&quot;__gcov_dump&quot;</span> facilities to restrict
    profile collection to the program region of interest. Calling
    <span class="Li">&quot;__gcov_reset(void)&quot;</span> will clear all
    profile counters to zero, and calling
    <span class="Li">&quot;__gcov_dump(void)&quot;</span> will cause the profile
    information collected at that point to be dumped to <i>.gcda</i> output
    files. Instrumented applications use a static destructor with priority 99 to
    invoke the <span class="Li">&quot;__gcov_dump&quot;</span> function. Thus
    <span class="Li">&quot;__gcov_dump&quot;</span> is executed after all user
    defined static destructors, as well as handlers registered with
    <span class="Li">&quot;atexit&quot;</span>. If an executable loads a dynamic
    shared object via dlopen functionality, <b>-Wl,--dynamic-list-data</b> is
    needed to dump all profile data.</p>
<p class="Pp">Profiling run-time library reports various errors related to
    profile manipulation and profile saving. Errors are printed into standard
    error output or <b>GCOV_ERROR_FILE</b> file, if environment variable is
    used. In order to terminate immediately after an errors occurs set
    <b>GCOV_EXIT_AT_ERROR</b> environment variable. That can help users to find
    profile clashing which leads to a misleading profile.</p>
