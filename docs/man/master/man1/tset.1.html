  - initialization</a></h2>
This program initializes terminals.
<p class="Pp">First, <b>tset</b> retrieves the current terminal mode settings
    for your terminal. It does this by successively testing</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>the standard error,</li>
  <li>standard output,</li>
  <li>standard input and</li>
  <li>ultimately &#x201C;/dev/tty&#x201D;</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">to obtain terminal settings. Having retrieved these settings,
    <b>tset</b> remembers which file descriptor to use when updating
  settings.</p>
<p class="Pp">Next, <b>tset</b> determines the type of terminal that you are
    using. This determination is done as follows, using the first terminal type
    found.</p>
<p class="Pp">1. The <b>terminal</b> argument specified on the command line.</p>
<p class="Pp">2. The value of the <b>TERM</b> environmental variable.</p>
<p class="Pp">3. (BSD systems only.) The terminal type associated with the
    standard error output device in the <i>/etc/ttys</i> file. (On System-V-like
    UNIXes and systems using that convention, <i>getty</i> does this job by
    setting <b>TERM</b> according to the type passed to it by
    <i>/etc/inittab</i>.)</p>
<p class="Pp">4. The default terminal type, &#x201C;unknown&#x201D;.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the terminal type was not specified on the command-line, the
    <b>-m</b> option mappings are then applied (see the section <b>TERMINAL TYPE
    MAPPING</b> for more information). Then, if the terminal type begins with a
    question mark (&#x201C;?&#x201D;), the user is prompted for confirmation of
    the terminal type. An empty response confirms the type, or, another type can
    be entered to specify a new type. Once the terminal type has been
    determined, the terminal description for the terminal is retrieved. If no
    terminal description is found for the type, the user is prompted for another
    terminal type.</p>
<p class="Pp">Once the terminal description is retrieved,</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>&#x2022;</dt>
  <dd>if the &#x201C;<b>-w</b>&#x201D; option is enabled, <b>tset</b> may update
      the terminal's window size.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>If the window size cannot be obtained from the operating system, but the
      terminal description (or environment, e.g., <b>LINES</b> and
      <b>COLUMNS</b> variables specify this), use this to set the operating
      system's notion of the window size.</dd>
</dl>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>if the &#x201C;<b>-c</b>&#x201D; option is enabled, the backspace,
      interrupt and line kill characters (among many other things) are set</li>
  <li>unless the &#x201C;<b>-I</b>&#x201D; option is enabled, the terminal and
      tab <i>initialization</i> strings are sent to the standard error output,
      and <b>tset</b> waits one second (in case a hardware reset was
    issued).</li>
  <li>Finally, if the erase, interrupt and line kill characters have changed, or
      are not set to their default values, their values are displayed to the
      standard error output.</li>
</ul>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="reset_-_reinitialization"><a class="permalink" href="#reset_-_reinitialization">reset

When invoked as <b>reset</b>, <b>tset</b> sets the terminal modes to
  &#x201C;sane&#x201D; values:
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>sets cooked and echo modes,</li>
  <li>turns off cbreak and raw modes,</li>
  <li>turns on newline translation and</li>
  <li>resets any unset special characters to their default values</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">before doing the terminal initialization described above. Also,
    rather than using the terminal <i>initialization</i> strings, it uses the
    terminal <i>reset</i> strings.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>reset</b> command is useful after a program dies leaving a
    terminal in an abnormal state:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>you may have to type
    <p class="Pp">
       <i>&lt;LF&gt;</i><b>reset</b><i>&lt;LF&gt;</i></p>
    <p class="Pp">(the line-feed character is normally control-J) to get the
        terminal to work, as carriage-return may no longer work in the abnormal
        state.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Also, the terminal will often not echo the command.</li>
</ul>

The options are as follows:

  <dt><b>-Q</b></dt>
  <dd>Do not display any values for the erase, interrupt and line kill

      characters which differ from the system's default values.</dd>
  <dt><b>-q</b></dt>
  <dd>The terminal type is displayed to the standard output, and the terminal is

<h1 class="Sh" id="SETTING_THE_ENVIRONMENT"><a class="permalink" href="#SETTING_THE_ENVIRONMENT">SETTING
  THE ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
It is often desirable to enter the terminal type and information about the
  terminal's capabilities into the shell's environment. This is done using the
  <b>-s</b> option.
<p class="Pp">When the <b>-s</b> option is specified, the commands to enter the
    information into the shell's environment are written to the standard output.
    If the <b>SHELL</b> environmental variable ends in &#x201C;csh&#x201D;, the
    commands are for <b>csh</b>, otherwise, they are for <b>sh</b>. Note, the
    <b>csh</b> commands set and unset the shell variable <b>noglob</b>, leaving
    it unset. The following line in the <b>.login</b> or <b>.profile</b> files
    will initialize the environment correctly:</p>
<p class="Pp">
   eval `tset -s options ... `</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="TERMINAL_TYPE_MAPPING"><a class="permalink" href="#TERMINAL_TYPE_MAPPING">TERMINAL
  TYPE MAPPING</a></h1>
When the terminal is not hardwired into the system (or the current system
  information is incorrect) the terminal type derived from the <i>/etc/ttys</i>
  file or the <b>TERM</b> environmental variable is often something generic like
  <b>network</b>, <b>dialup</b>, or <b>unknown</b>. When <b>tset</b> is used in
  a startup script it is often desirable to provide information about the type
  of terminal used on such ports.
<p class="Pp">The <b>-m</b> options maps from some set of conditions to a
    terminal type, that is, to tell <b>tset</b> &#x201C;If I'm on this port at a
    particular speed, guess that I'm on that kind of terminal&#x201D;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The argument to the <b>-m</b> option consists of an optional port
    type, an optional operator, an optional baud rate specification, an optional
    colon (&#x201C;:&#x201D;) character and a terminal type. The port type is a
    string (delimited by either the operator or the colon character). The
    operator may be any combination of &#x201C;&gt;&#x201D;,
    &#x201C;&lt;&#x201D;, &#x201C;@&#x201D;, and &#x201C;!&#x201D;;
    &#x201C;&gt;&#x201D; means greater than, &#x201C;&lt;&#x201D; means less
    than, &#x201C;@&#x201D; means equal to and &#x201C;!&#x201D; inverts the
    sense of the test. The baud rate is specified as a number and is compared
    with the speed of the standard error output (which should be the control
    terminal). The terminal type is a string.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the terminal type is not specified on the command line, the
    <b>-m</b> mappings are applied to the terminal type. If the port type and
    baud rate match the mapping, the terminal type specified in the mapping
    replaces the current type. If more than one mapping is specified, the first
    applicable mapping is used.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example, consider the following mapping:
    <b>dialup&gt;9600:vt100</b>. The port type is dialup , the operator is &gt;,
    the baud rate specification is 9600, and the terminal type is vt100. The
    result of this mapping is to specify that if the terminal type is
    <b>dialup</b>, and the baud rate is greater than 9600 baud, a terminal type
    of <b>vt100</b> will be used.</p>
<p class="Pp">If no baud rate is specified, the terminal type will match any
    baud rate. If no port type is specified, the terminal type will match any
    port type. For example, <b>-m dialup:vt100 -m :?xterm</b> will cause any
    dialup port, regardless of baud rate, to match the terminal type vt100, and
    any non-dialup port type to match the terminal type ?xterm. Note, because of
    the leading question mark, the user will be queried on a default port as to
    whether they are actually using an xterm terminal.</p>
<p class="Pp">No whitespace characters are permitted in the <b>-m</b> option
    argument. Also, to avoid problems with meta-characters, it is suggested that
    the entire <b>-m</b> option argument be placed within single quote
    characters, and that <b>csh</b> users insert a backslash character
    (&#x201C;\&#x201D;) before any exclamation marks (&#x201C;!&#x201D;).</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="HISTORY"><a class="permalink" href="#HISTORY">HISTORY</a></h1>
A <b>reset</b> command appeared in 2BSD (April 1979), written by Kurt Shoens.
  This program set the <i>erase</i> and <i>kill</i> characters to <b>^H</b>
  (backspace) and <b>@</b> respectively. Mark Horton improved that in 3BSD
  (October 1979), adding <i>intr</i>, <i>quit</i>, <i>start</i>/<i>stop</i> and
  <i>eof</i> characters as well as changing the program to avoid modifying any
  user settings.
<p class="Pp">Later in 4.1BSD (December 1980), Mark Horton added a call to the
    <b>tset</b> program using the <b>-I</b> and <b>-Q</b> options, i.e., using
    that to improve the terminal modes. With those options, that version of
    <b>reset</b> did not use the termcap database.</p>
<p class="Pp">A separate <b>tset</b> command was provided in 2BSD by Eric
    Allman. While the oldest published source (from 1979) provides both
    <b>tset</b> and <b>reset</b>, Allman's comments in the 2BSD source code
    indicate that he began work in October 1977, continuing development over the
    next few years.</p>
<p class="Pp">In September 1980, Eric Allman modified <b>tset</b>, adding the
    code from the existing &#x201C;reset&#x201D; feature when <b>tset</b> was
    invoked as <b>reset</b>. Rather than simply copying the existing program, in
    this merged version, <b>tset</b> used the termcap database to do additional
    (re)initialization of the terminal. This version appeared in 4.1cBSD, late
    in 1982.</p>
<p class="Pp">Other developers (e.g., Keith Bostic and Jim Bloom) continued to
    modify <b>tset</b> until 4.4BSD was released in 1993.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>ncurses</b> implementation was lightly adapted from the
    4.4BSD sources for a terminfo environment by Eric S. Raymond
    &lt;esr@snark.thyrsus.com&gt;.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="COMPATIBILITY"><a class="permalink" href="#COMPATIBILITY">COMPATIBILITY</a></h1>
Neither IEEE Std 1003.1/The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 7
  (POSIX.1-2008) nor X/Open Curses Issue 7 documents <b>tset</b> or
  <b>reset</b>.
<p class="Pp">The AT&amp;T <b>tput</b> utility (AIX, HPUX, Solaris) incorporated
    the terminal-mode manipulation as well as termcap-based features such as
    resetting tabstops from <b>tset</b> in BSD (4.1c), presumably with the
    intention of making <b>tset</b> obsolete. However, each of those systems
    still provides <b>tset</b>. In fact, the commonly-used <b>reset</b> utility
    is always an alias for <b>tset</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>tset</b> utility provides for backward-compatibility with
    BSD environments (under most modern UNIXes, <b>/etc/inittab</b> and
    <b>getty</b>(1) can set <b>TERM</b> appropriately for each dial-up line;
    this obviates what was <b>tset</b>'s most important use). This
    implementation behaves like 4.4BSD <b>tset</b>, with a few exceptions
    specified here.</p>
<p class="Pp">A few options are different because the <b>TERMCAP</b> variable is
    no longer supported under terminfo-based <b>ncurses</b>:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The <b>-S</b> option of BSD <b>tset</b> no longer works; it prints an
      error message to the standard error and dies.</li>
  <li>The <b>-s</b> option only sets <b>TERM</b>, not <b>TERMCAP</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">There was an undocumented 4.4BSD feature that invoking <b>tset</b>
    via a link named &#x201C;TSET&#x201D; (or via any other name beginning with
    an upper-case letter) set the terminal to use upper-case only. This feature
    has been omitted.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-A</b>, <b>-E</b>, <b>-h</b>, <b>-u</b> and <b>-v</b>
    options were deleted from the <b>tset</b> utility in 4.4BSD. None of them
    were documented in 4.3BSD and all are of limited utility at best. The
    <b>-a</b>, <b>-d</b>, and <b>-p</b> options are similarly not documented or
    useful, but were retained as they appear to be in widespread use. It is
    strongly recommended that any usage of these three options be changed to use
    the <b>-m</b> option instead. The <b>-a</b>, <b>-d</b>, and <b>-p</b>
    options are therefore omitted from the usage summary above.</p>
<p class="Pp">Very old systems, e.g., 3BSD, used a different terminal driver
    which was replaced in 4BSD in the early 1980s. To accommodate these older
    systems, the 4BSD <b>tset</b> provided a <b>-n</b> option to specify that
    the new terminal driver should be used. This implementation does not provide
    that choice.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is still permissible to specify the <b>-e</b>, <b>-i</b>, and
    <b>-k</b> options without arguments, although it is strongly recommended
    that such usage be fixed to explicitly specify the character.</p>
<p class="Pp">As of 4.4BSD, executing <b>tset</b> as <b>reset</b> no longer
    implies the <b>-Q</b> option. Also, the interaction between the - option and
    the <i>terminal</i> argument in some historic implementations of <b>tset</b>
    has been removed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>-c</b> and <b>-w</b> options are not found in earlier
    implementations. However, a different window size-change feature was
    provided in 4.4BSD.</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>In 4.4BSD, <b>tset</b> uses the window size from the termcap description
      to set the window size if <b>tset</b> is not able to obtain the window
      size from the operating system.</li>
  <li>In ncurses, <b>tset</b> obtains the window size using <b>setupterm</b>,
      which may be from the operating system, the <b>LINES</b> and
      <b>COLUMNS</b> environment variables or the terminal description.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Obtaining the window size from the terminal description is common
    to both implementations, but considered obsolescent. Its only practical use
    is for hardware terminals. Generally speaking, a window size would be unset
    only if there were some problem obtaining the value from the operating
    system (and <b>setupterm</b> would still fail). For that reason, the
    <b>LINES</b> and <b>COLUMNS</b> environment variables may be useful for
    working around window-size problems. Those have the drawback that if the
    window is resized, those variables must be recomputed and reassigned. To do
    this more easily, use the <b>resize</b>(1) program.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="ENVIRONMENT"><a class="permalink" href="#ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></h1>
The <b>tset</b> command uses these environment variables:
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd>tells <b>tset</b> whether to initialize <b>TERM</b> using <b>sh</b> or

  <dd>may denote the location of a termcap database. If it is not an absolute
