perl5124delta - what is new for perl v5.12.4
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document describes differences between the 5.12.3 release and the 5.12.4
  release.
<p class="Pp">If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.12.2, first
    read perl5123delta, which describes differences between 5.12.2 and 5.12.3.
    The major changes made in 5.12.0 are described in perl5120delta.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Incompatible_Changes"><a class="permalink" href="#Incompatible_Changes">Incompatible
  Changes</a></h1>
There are no changes intentionally incompatible with 5.12.3. If any exist, they
  are bugs and reports are welcome.

When strict &quot;refs&quot; mode is off,
  <span class="Li">&quot;%{...}&quot;</span> in rvalue context returns
  <span class="Li">&quot;undef&quot;</span> if its argument is undefined. An
  optimisation introduced in Perl 5.12.0 to make <span class="Li">&quot;keys
  %{...}&quot;</span> faster when used as a boolean did not take this into
  account, causing <span class="Li">&quot;keys %{+undef}&quot;</span> (and
  <span class="Li">&quot;keys %$foo&quot;</span> when
  <span class="Li">$foo</span> is undefined) to be an error, which it should be
  so in strict mode only [perl #81750].
<p class="Pp"><span class="Li">&quot;lc&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;uc&quot;</span>,
    <span class="Li">&quot;lcfirst&quot;</span>, and
    <span class="Li">&quot;ucfirst&quot;</span> no longer return untainted
    strings when the argument is tainted. This has been broken since perl 5.8.9
    [perl #87336].</p>
<p class="Pp">Fixed a case where it was possible that a freed buffer may have
    been read from when parsing a here document.</p>

  Bugs</a></h1>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
  http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information at
  http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the
    <b>perlbug</b> program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug
    down to a tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the
    output of <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make
    it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
    send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
    subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
    committers, who be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a
    resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix
    the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use
    this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules
    independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
