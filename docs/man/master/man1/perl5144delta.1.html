perl5144delta - what is new for perl v5.14.4
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
This document describes differences between the 5.14.3 release and the 5.14.4
  release.
<p class="Pp">If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.12.0, first
    read perl5140delta, which describes differences between 5.12.0 and
  5.14.0.</p>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Core_Enhancements"><a class="permalink" href="#Core_Enhancements">Core
  Enhancements</a></h1>
No changes since 5.14.0.
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="Security"><a class="permalink" href="#Security">Security</a></h1>
This release contains one major, and medium, and a number of minor security
  fixes. The latter are included mainly to allow the test suite to pass cleanly
  with the clang compiler's address sanitizer facility.

<h2 class="Ss" id="_s-1CVE_-2013_-1667:_s0_memory_exhaustion_with_arbitrary_hash_keys"><a class="permalink" href="#_s-1CVE_-2013_-1667:_s0_memory_exhaustion_with_arbitrary_hash_keys">CVE-2013-1667:
  memory exhaustion with arbitrary hash keys</a></h2>
With a carefully crafted set of hash keys (for example arguments on a URL), it
  is possible to cause a hash to consume a large amount of memory and CPU, and
  thus possibly to achieve a Denial-of-Service.
<p class="Pp">This problem has been fixed.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="memory_leak_in_Encode"><a class="permalink" href="#memory_leak_in_Encode">memory
  leak in Encode</a></h2>
The UTF-8 encoding implementation in Encode.xs had a memory leak which has been
  fixed.

  #111594] Socket::unpack_sockaddr_un heap-buffer-overflow</a></h2>
A read buffer overflow could occur when copying
  <span class="Li">&quot;sockaddr&quot;</span> buffers. Fairly harmless.
<p class="Pp">This problem has been fixed.</p>

  #111586] SDBM_File: fix off-by-one access to global &quot;.dir&quot;</a></h2>
An extra byte was being copied for some string literals. Fairly harmless.
<p class="Pp">This problem has been fixed.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="off-by-two_error_in_List::Util"><a class="permalink" href="#off-by-two_error_in_List::Util">off-by-two
  error in List::Util</a></h2>
A string literal was being used that included two bytes beyond the end of the
  string. Fairly harmless.
<p class="Pp">This problem has been fixed.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="_perl__115994__fix_segv_in_regcomp._fBc:S_join_exact()_fP"><a class="permalink" href="#_perl__115994__fix_segv_in_regcomp._fBc:S_join_exact()_fP">[perl
  #115994] fix segv in regcomp.<b>c:S_join_exact()</b></a></h2>
Under debugging builds, while marking optimised-out regex nodes as type
  <span class="Li">&quot;OPTIMIZED&quot;</span>, it could treat blocks of exact
  text as if they were nodes, and thus SEGV. Fairly harmless.
<p class="Pp">This problem has been fixed.</p>

  #115992] PL_eval_start use-after-free</a></h2>
The statement <span class="Li">&quot;local $[;&quot;</span>, when preceded by an
  <span class="Li">&quot;eval&quot;</span>, and when not part of an assignment,
  could crash. Fairly harmless.
<p class="Pp">This problem has been fixed.</p>

Reading or writing strings greater than 2**31 bytes in size could segfault due
  to integer wraparound.
<p class="Pp">This problem has been fixed.</p>

Perl 5.14.4 represents approximately 5 months of development since Perl 5.14.3
  and contains approximately 1,700 lines of changes across 49 files from 12
  authors.
<p class="Pp">Perl continues to flourish into its third decade thanks to a
    vibrant community of users and developers. The following people are known to
    have contributed the improvements that became Perl 5.14.4:</p>
<p class="Pp">Andy Dougherty, Chris 'BinGOs' Williams, Christian Hansen, Craig
    A. Berry, Dave Rolsky, David Mitchell, Dominic Hargreaves, Father
    Chrysostomos, Florian Ragwitz, Reini Urban, Ricardo Signes, Yves Orton.</p>
<p class="Pp">The list above is almost certainly incomplete as it is
    automatically generated from version control history. In particular, it does
    not include the names of the (very much appreciated) contributors who
    reported issues to the Perl bug tracker.</p>
<p class="Pp">For a more complete list of all of Perl's historical contributors,

<h1 class="Sh" id="Reporting_Bugs"><a class="permalink" href="#Reporting_Bugs">Reporting
  Bugs</a></h1>
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles recently
  posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug database at
  http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information at
  http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
<p class="Pp">If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the perlbug
    program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a tiny
    but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output of
    <span class="Li">&quot;perl -V&quot;</span>, will be sent off to
    perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by the Perl porting team.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make
    it inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
    send it to perl5-security-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
    subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
    committers, who be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a
    resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix
    the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use
    this address for security issues in the Perl core, not for modules
    independently distributed on CPAN.</p>
