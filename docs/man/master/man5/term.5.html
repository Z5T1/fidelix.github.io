Compiled terminfo descriptions are placed under the directory
  <b>/usr/share/terminfo</b>. Two configurations are supported (when building
  the <b>ncurses</b> libraries):
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>directory tree</b></dt>
  <dd>A two-level scheme is used to avoid a linear search of a huge UNIX system
      directory: <b>/usr/share/terminfo/c/name</b> where <i>name</i> is the name
      of the terminal, and <i>c</i> is the first character of <i>name</i>. Thus,
      <i>act4</i> can be found in the file <b>/usr/share/terminfo/a/act4</b>.
      Synonyms for the same terminal are implemented by multiple links to the
      same compiled file.</dd>
  <dt><b>hashed database</b></dt>
  <dd>Using Berkeley database, two types of records are stored: the terminfo
      data in the same format as stored in a directory tree with the terminfo's
      primary name as a key, and records containing only aliases pointing to the
      primary name.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>If built to write hashed databases, <b>ncurses</b> can still read terminfo
      databases organized as a directory tree, but cannot write entries into the
      directory tree. It can write (or rewrite) entries in the hashed
    database.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><b>ncurses</b> distinguishes the two cases in the TERMINFO and
      TERMINFO_DIRS environment variable by assuming a directory tree for
      entries that correspond to an existing directory, and hashed database
      otherwise.</dd>
</dl>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="LEGACY_STORAGE_FORMAT"><a class="permalink" href="#LEGACY_STORAGE_FORMAT">LEGACY
  STORAGE FORMAT</a></h2>
The format has been chosen so that it will be the same on all hardware. An 8 or
  more bit byte is assumed, but no assumptions about byte ordering or sign
  extension are made.
<p class="Pp">The compiled file is created with the <b>tic</b> program, and read
    by the routine <b>setupterm</b>(3X). The file is divided into six parts: the
    header, terminal names, boolean flags, numbers, strings, and string
  table.</p>
<p class="Pp">The header section begins the file. This section contains six
    short integers in the format described below. These integers are</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>(1) the magic number (octal 0432);</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>(2) the size, in bytes, of the names section;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>(3) the number of bytes in the boolean section;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>(4) the number of short integers in the numbers section;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>(5) the number of offsets (short integers) in the strings section;</dt>
  <dd></dd>
  <dt>(6) the size, in bytes, of the string table.</dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Short integers are stored in two 8-bit bytes. The first byte
    contains the least significant 8 bits of the value, and the second byte
    contains the most significant 8 bits. (Thus, the value represented is
    256*second+first.) The value -1 is represented by the two bytes 0377, 0377;
    other negative values are illegal. This value generally means that the
    corresponding capability is missing from this terminal. Note that this
    format corresponds to the hardware of the VAX and PDP-11 (that is,
    little-endian machines). Machines where this does not correspond to the
    hardware must read the integers as two bytes and compute the little-endian
    value.</p>
<p class="Pp">The terminal names section comes next. It contains the first line
    of the terminfo description, listing the various names for the terminal,
    separated by the &#x201C;|&#x201D; character. The section is terminated with
    an ASCII NUL character.</p>
<p class="Pp">The boolean flags have one byte for each flag. This byte is either
    0 or 1 as the flag is present or absent. The capabilities are in the same
    order as the file &lt;term.h&gt;.</p>
<p class="Pp">Between the boolean section and the number section, a null byte
    will be inserted, if necessary, to ensure that the number section begins on
    an even byte (this is a relic of the PDP-11's word-addressed architecture,
    originally designed in to avoid IOT traps induced by addressing a word on an
    odd byte boundary). All short integers are aligned on a short word
  boundary.</p>
<p class="Pp">The numbers section is similar to the flags section. Each
    capability takes up two bytes, and is stored as a little-endian short
    integer. If the value represented is -1, the capability is taken to be
    missing.</p>
<p class="Pp">The strings section is also similar. Each capability is stored as
    a short integer, in the format above. A value of -1 means the capability is
    missing. Otherwise, the value is taken as an offset from the beginning of
    the string table. Special characters in ^X or \c notation are stored in
    their interpreted form, not the printing representation. Padding information
    $&lt;nn&gt; and parameter information %x are stored intact in uninterpreted
    form.</p>
<p class="Pp">The final section is the string table. It contains all the values
    of string capabilities referenced in the string section. Each string is null
    terminated.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="EXTENDED_STORAGE_FORMAT"><a class="permalink" href="#EXTENDED_STORAGE_FORMAT">EXTENDED
  STORAGE FORMAT</a></h2>
The previous section describes the conventional terminfo binary format. With
  some minor variations of the offsets (see PORTABILITY), the same binary format
  is used in all modern UNIX systems. Each system uses a predefined set of
  boolean, number or string capabilities.
<p class="Pp">The <b>ncurses</b> libraries and applications support extended
    terminfo binary format, allowing users to define capabilities which are
    loaded at runtime. This extension is made possible by using the fact that
    the other implementations stop reading the terminfo data when they have
    reached the end of the size given in the header. <b>ncurses</b> checks the
    size, and if it exceeds that due to the predefined data, continues to parse
    according to its own scheme.</p>
<p class="Pp">First, it reads the extended header (5 short integers):</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>(1)</dt>
  <dd>count of extended boolean capabilities</dd>
  <dt>(2)</dt>
  <dd>count of extended numeric capabilities</dd>
  <dt>(3)</dt>
  <dd>count of extended string capabilities</dd>
  <dt>(4)</dt>
  <dd>count of the items in extended string table</dd>
  <dt>(5)</dt>
  <dd>size of the extended string table in bytes</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The count- and size-values for the extended string table include
    the extended capability <i>names</i> as well as extended capability
    <i>values</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Using the counts and sizes, <b>ncurses</b> allocates arrays and
    reads data for the extended capabilities in the same order as the header
    information.</p>
<p class="Pp">The extended string table contains values for string capabilities.
    After the end of these values, it contains the names for each of the
    extended capabilities in order, e.g., booleans, then numbers and finally
    strings.</p>
<p class="Pp">Applications which manipulate terminal data can use the
    definitions described in <b>term_variables</b>(3X) which associate the long
    capability names with members of a <b>TERMTYPE</b> structure.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="EXTENDED_NUMBER_FORMAT"><a class="permalink" href="#EXTENDED_NUMBER_FORMAT">EXTENDED
  NUMBER FORMAT</a></h2>
On occasion, 16-bit signed integers are not large enough. With <b>ncurses</b>
  6.1, a new format was introduced by making a few changes to the legacy format:
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>a different magic number (octal 01036)</li>
  <li>changing the type for the <i>number</i> array from signed 16-bit integers
      to signed 32-bit integers.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">To maintain compatibility, the library presents the same data
    structures to direct users of the <b>TERMTYPE</b> structure as in previous
    formats. However, that cannot provide callers with the extended numbers. The
    library uses a similar but hidden data structure <b>TERMTYPE2</b> to provide
    data for the terminfo functions.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="setupterm"><a class="permalink" href="#setupterm">setupterm</a></h2>
Note that it is possible for <b>setupterm</b> to expect a different set of
  capabilities than are actually present in the file. Either the database may
  have been updated since <b>setupterm</b> has been recompiled (resulting in
  extra unrecognized entries in the file) or the program may have been
  recompiled more recently than the database was updated (resulting in missing
  entries). The routine <b>setupterm</b> must be prepared for both possibilities
  - this is why the numbers and sizes are included. Also, new capabilities must
  always be added at the end of the lists of boolean, number, and string
  capabilities.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Binary_format"><a class="permalink" href="#Binary_format">Binary
  format</a></h2>
X/Open Curses does not specify a format for the terminfo database. UNIX System V
  curses used a directory-tree of binary files, one per terminal description.
<p class="Pp">Despite the consistent use of little-endian for numbers and the
    otherwise self-describing format, it is not wise to count on portability of
    binary terminfo entries between commercial UNIX versions. The problem is
    that there are at least three versions of terminfo (under HP-UX, AIX, and
    OSF/1) which diverged from System V terminfo after SVr1, and have added
    extension capabilities to the string table that (in the binary format)
    collide with System V and XSI Curses extensions. See <b>terminfo</b>(5) for
    detailed discussion of terminfo source compatibility issues.</p>
<p class="Pp">This implementation is by default compatible with the binary
    terminfo format used by Solaris curses, except in a few less-used details
    where it was found that the latter did not match X/Open Curses. The format
    used by the other Unix versions can be matched by building ncurses with
    different configuration options.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Magic_codes"><a class="permalink" href="#Magic_codes">Magic
  codes</a></h2>
The magic number in a binary terminfo file is the first 16-bits (two bytes).
  Besides making it more reliable for the library to check that a file is
  terminfo, utilities such as <b>file</b> also use that to tell what the
  file-format is. System V defined more than one magic number, with 0433, 0435
  as screen-dumps (see <b>scr_dump</b>(5)). This implementation uses 01036 as a
  continuation of that sequence, but with a different high-order byte to avoid
  confusion.

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="The_TERMTYPE_structure"><a class="permalink" href="#The_TERMTYPE_structure">The
  TERMTYPE structure</a></h2>
Direct access to the <b>TERMTYPE</b> structure is provided for legacy
  applications. Portable applications should use the <b>tigetflag</b> and
  related functions described in <b>curs_terminfo</b>(3X) for reading terminal
  capabilities.

<h2 class="Ss" id="Mixed-case_terminal_names"><a class="permalink" href="#Mixed-case_terminal_names">Mixed-case
  terminal names</a></h2>
A small number of terminal descriptions use uppercase characters in their names.
  If the underlying filesystem ignores the difference between uppercase and
  lowercase, <b>ncurses</b> represents the &#x201C;first character&#x201D; of
  the terminal name used as the intermediate level of a directory tree in
  (two-character) hexadecimal form.
