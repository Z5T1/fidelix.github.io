The <i>resolver</i> is a set of routines in the C library that provide access to
  the Internet Domain Name System (DNS). The resolver configuration file
  contains information that is read by the resolver routines the first time they
  are invoked by a process. The file is designed to be human readable and
  contains a list of keywords with values that provide various types of resolver
  information. The configuration file is considered a trusted source of DNS
  information (e.g., DNSSEC AD-bit information will be returned unmodified from
  this source).
<p class="Pp">If this file does not exist, only the name server on the local
    machine will be queried, and the search list contains the local domain name
    determined from the hostname.</p>
<p class="Pp">The different configuration options are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>nameserver</b> Name server IP address</dt>
  <dd>Internet address of a name server that the resolver should query, either
      an IPv4 address (in dot notation), or an IPv6 address in colon (and
      possibly dot) notation as per RFC 2373. Up to <b>MAXNS</b> (currently 3,
      see <i>&lt;resolv.h&gt;</i>) name servers may be listed, one per keyword.
      If there are multiple servers, the resolver library queries them in the
      order listed. If no <b>nameserver</b> entries are present, the default is
      to use the name server on the local machine. (The algorithm used is to try
      a name server, and if the query times out, try the next, until out of name
      servers, then repeat trying all the name servers until a maximum number of
      retries are made.)</dd>
  <dt><b>search</b> Search list for host-name lookup.</dt>
  <dd>By default, the search list contains one entry, the local domain name. It
      is determined from the local hostname returned by <b>gethostname</b>(2);
      the local domain name is taken to be everything after the first '.'.
      Finally, if the hostname does not contain a '.', the root domain is
      assumed as the local domain name.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>This may be changed by listing the desired domain search path following
      the <i>search</i> keyword with spaces or tabs separating the names.
      Resolver queries having fewer than <i>ndots</i> dots (default is 1) in
      them will be attempted using each component of the search path in turn
      until a match is found. For environments with multiple subdomains please
      read <b>options ndots:</b><i>n</i> below to avoid man-in-the-middle
      attacks and unnecessary traffic for the root-dns-servers. Note that this
      process may be slow and will generate a lot of network traffic if the
      servers for the listed domains are not local, and that queries will time
      out if no server is available for one of the domains.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>If there are multiple <b>search</b> directives, only the search list from
      the last instance is used.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>In glibc 2.25 and earlier, the search list is limited to six domains with
      a total of 256 characters. Since glibc 2.26, the search list is
    unlimited.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The <b>domain</b> directive is an obsolete name for the <b>search</b>
      directive that handles one search list entry only.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>sortlist</b></dt>
  <dd>This option allows addresses returned by <b>gethostbyname</b>(3) to be
      sorted. A sortlist is specified by IP-address-netmask pairs. The netmask
      is optional and defaults to the natural netmask of the net. The IP address
      and optional network pairs are separated by slashes. Up to 10 pairs may be
      specified. Here is an example:</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    sortlist 130.155.160.0/255.255.240.0 130.155.0.0
    <br/>
  </dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>options</b></dt>
  <dd>Options allows certain internal resolver variables to be modified. The
      syntax is</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd><b>options</b> <i>option</i> <i>...</i></dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">where <i>option</i> is one of the following:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>debug</b></dt>
  <dd>Sets <b>RES_DEBUG</b> in <i>_res.options</i> (effective only if glibc was
      built with debug support; see <b>resolver</b>(3)).</dd>
  <dt><b>ndots:</b><i>n</i></dt>
  <dd>Sets a threshold for the number of dots which must appear in a name given
      to <b>res_query</b>(3) (see <b>resolver</b>(3)) before an <i>initial
      absolute query</i> will be made. The default for <i>n</i> is 1, meaning
      that if there are any dots in a name, the name will be tried first as an
      absolute name before any <i>search list</i> elements are appended to it.
      The value for this option is silently capped to 15.</dd>
  <dt><b>timeout:</b><i>n</i></dt>
  <dd>Sets the amount of time the resolver will wait for a response from a
      remote name server before retrying the query via a different name server.
      This may <b>not</b> be the total time taken by any resolver API call and
      there is no guarantee that a single resolver API call maps to a single
      timeout. Measured in seconds, the default is <b>RES_TIMEOUT</b> (currently
      5, see <i>&lt;resolv.h&gt;</i>). The value for this option is silently
      capped to 30.</dd>
  <dt><b>attempts:</b><i>n</i></dt>
  <dd>Sets the number of times the resolver will send a query to its name
      servers before giving up and returning an error to the calling
      application. The default is <b>RES_DFLRETRY</b> (currently 2, see
      <i>&lt;resolv.h&gt;</i>). The value for this option is silently capped to
      5.</dd>
  <dt><b>rotate</b></dt>
  <dd>Sets <b>RES_ROTATE</b> in <i>_res.options</i>, which causes round-robin
      selection of name servers from among those listed. This has the effect of
      spreading the query load among all listed servers, rather than having all
      clients try the first listed server first every time.</dd>
  <dt><b>no-check-names</b></dt>
  <dd>Sets <b>RES_NOCHECKNAME</b> in <i>_res.options</i>, which disables the
      modern BIND checking of incoming hostnames and mail names for invalid
      characters such as underscore (_), non-ASCII, or control characters.</dd>
  <dt><b>inet6</b></dt>
  <dd>Sets <b>RES_USE_INET6</b> in <i>_res.options</i>. This has the effect of
      trying an AAAA query before an A query inside the <b>gethostbyname</b>(3)
      function, and of mapping IPv4 responses in IPv6 &quot;tunneled form&quot;
      if no AAAA records are found but an A record set exists. Since glibc 2.25,
      this option is deprecated; applications should use <b>getaddrinfo</b>(3),
      rather than <b>gethostbyname</b>(3).</dd>
  <dt><b>ip6-bytestring</b> (since glibc 2.3.4)</dt>
  <dd>Sets <b>RES_USEBSTRING</b> in <i>_res.options</i>. This causes reverse
      IPv6 lookups to be made using the bit-label format described in
      RFC&#x00A0;2673; if this option is not set (which is the default), then
      nibble format is used. This option was removed in glibc 2.25, since it
      relied on a backward-incompatible DNS extension that was never deployed on
      the Internet.</dd>
  <dt><b>ip6-dotint</b>/<b>no-ip6-dotint</b> (glibc 2.3.4 to 2.24)</dt>
  <dd>Clear/set <b>RES_NOIP6DOTINT</b> in <i>_res.options</i>. When this option
      is clear (<b>ip6-dotint</b>), reverse IPv6 lookups are made in the
      (deprecated) <i>ip6.int</i> zone; when this option is set
      (<b>no-ip6-dotint</b>), reverse IPv6 lookups are made in the
      <i>ip6.arpa</i> zone by default. These options are available in glibc
      versions up to 2.24, where <b>no-ip6-dotint</b> is the default. Since
      <b>ip6-dotint</b> support long ago ceased to be available on the Internet,
      these options were removed in glibc 2.25.</dd>
  <dt><b>edns0</b> (since glibc 2.6)</dt>
  <dd>Sets <b>RES_USE_EDNSO</b> in <i>_res.options</i>. This enables support for
      the DNS extensions described in RFC&#x00A0;2671.</dd>
  <dt><b>single-request</b> (since glibc 2.10)</dt>
  <dd>Sets <b>RES_SNGLKUP</b> in <i>_res.options</i>. By default, glibc performs
      IPv4 and IPv6 lookups in parallel since version 2.9. Some appliance DNS
      servers cannot handle these queries properly and make the requests time
      out. This option disables the behavior and makes glibc perform the IPv6
      and IPv4 requests sequentially (at the cost of some slowdown of the
      resolving process).</dd>
  <dt><b>single-request-reopen</b> (since glibc 2.9)</dt>
  <dd>Sets <b>RES_SNGLKUPREOP</b> in <i>_res.options</i>. The resolver uses the
      same socket for the A and AAAA requests. Some hardware mistakenly sends
      back only one reply. When that happens the client system will sit and wait
      for the second reply. Turning this option on changes this behavior so that
      if two requests from the same port are not handled correctly it will close
      the socket and open a new one before sending the second request.</dd>
  <dt><b>no-tld-query</b> (since glibc 2.14)</dt>
  <dd>Sets <b>RES_NOTLDQUERY</b> in <i>_res.options</i>. This option causes
      <b>res_nsearch</b>() to not attempt to resolve an unqualified name as if
      it were a top level domain (TLD). This option can cause problems if the
      site has ``localhost'' as a TLD rather than having localhost on one or
      more elements of the search list. This option has no effect if neither
      RES_DEFNAMES or RES_DNSRCH is set.</dd>
  <dt><b>use-vc</b> (since glibc 2.14)</dt>
  <dd>Sets <b>RES_USEVC</b> in <i>_res.options</i>. This option forces the use
      of TCP for DNS resolutions.</dd>
  <dt><b>no-reload</b> (since glibc 2.26)</dt>
  <dd>Sets <b>RES_NORELOAD</b> in <i>_res.options</i>. This option disables
      automatic reloading of a changed configuration file.</dd>
