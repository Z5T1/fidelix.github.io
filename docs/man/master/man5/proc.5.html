proc - process information pseudo-filesystem
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The <b>proc</b> filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem which provides an interface to
  kernel data structures. It is commonly mounted at <i>/proc</i>. Typically, it
  is mounted automatically by the system, but it can also be mounted manually
  using a command such as:
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
mount -t proc proc /proc

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">Most of the files in the <b>proc</b> filesystem are read-only, but
    some files are writable, allowing kernel variables to be changed.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Mount_options"><a class="permalink" href="#Mount_options">Mount
  options</a></h2>
The <b>proc</b> filesystem supports the following mount options:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>hidepid</b>=<i>n</i> (since Linux 3.3)</dt>
  <dd>This option controls who can access the information in <i>/proc/[pid]</i>
      directories. The argument, <i>n</i>, is one of the following values:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>0</dt>
  <dd>Everybody may access all <i>/proc/[pid]</i> directories. This is the
      traditional behavior, and the default if this mount option is not
      specified.</dd>
  <dt>1</dt>
  <dd>Users may not access files and subdirectories inside any
      <i>/proc/[pid]</i> directories but their own (the <i>/proc/[pid]</i>
      directories themselves remain visible). Sensitive files such as
      <i>/proc/[pid]/cmdline</i> and <i>/proc/[pid]/status</i> are now protected
      against other users. This makes it impossible to learn whether any user is
      running a specific program (so long as the program doesn't otherwise
      reveal itself by its behavior).</dd>
  <dt>2</dt>
  <dd>As for mode 1, but in addition the <i>/proc/[pid]</i> directories
      belonging to other users become invisible. This means that
      <i>/proc/[pid]</i> entries can no longer be used to discover the PIDs on
      the system. This doesn't hide the fact that a process with a specific PID
      value exists (it can be learned by other means, for example, by &quot;kill
      -0 $PID&quot;), but it hides a process's UID and GID, which could
      otherwise be learned by employing <b>stat</b>(2) on a <i>/proc/[pid]</i>
      directory. This greatly complicates an attacker's task of gathering
      information about running processes (e.g., discovering whether some daemon
      is running with elevated privileges, whether another user is running some
      sensitive program, whether other users are running any program at all, and
      so on).</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>gid</b>=<i>gid</i> (since Linux 3.3)</dt>
  <dd>Specifies the ID of a group whose members are authorized to learn process
      information otherwise prohibited by <b>hidepid</b> (i.e., users in this
      group behave as though <i>/proc</i> was mounted with <i>hidepid=0</i>).
      This group should be used instead of approaches such as putting nonroot
      users into the <b>sudoers</b>(5) file.</dd>

The following list provides details of many of the files and directories under

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>/proc/[pid]</i></dt>
  <dd>There is a numerical subdirectory for each running process; the

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The files inside each <i>/proc/[pid]</i> directory are normally owned by
      the effective user and effective group ID of the process. However, as a
      security measure, the ownership is made <i>root:root</i> if the process's
      &quot;dumpable&quot; attribute is set to a value other than 1.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Before Linux 4.11, <i>root:root</i> meant the &quot;global&quot; root user
      ID and group ID (i.e., UID 0 and GID 0 in the initial user namespace).
      Since Linux 4.11, if the process is in a noninitial user namespace that
      has a valid mapping for user (group) ID 0 inside the namespace, then the
      user (group) ownership of the files under <i>/proc/[pid]</i> is instead
      made the same as the root user (group) ID of the namespace. This means
      that inside a container, things work as expected for the container
      &quot;root&quot; user.</dd>

      Prior to Linux 2.6.11, this file could not be used to set the security
      context (a write was always denied), since SELinux limited process
      security transitions to <b>execve</b>(2) (see the description of
      <i>/proc/[pid]/attr/exec</i>, below). Since Linux 2.6.11, SELinux lifted
      this restriction and began supporting &quot;set&quot; operations via
      writes to this node if authorized by policy, although use of this
      operation is only suitable for applications that are trusted to maintain
      any desired separation between the old and new security contexts.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Prior to Linux 2.6.28, SELinux did not allow threads within a
      multi-threaded process to set their security context via this node as it
      would yield an inconsistency among the security contexts of the threads
      sharing the same memory space. Since Linux 2.6.28, SELinux lifted this
      restriction and began supporting &quot;set&quot; operations for threads
      within a multithreaded process if the new security context is bounded by
      the old security context, where the bounded relation is defined in policy
      and guarantees that the new security context has a subset of the

      reset on <b>execve</b>(2) so that the new program reverts to the default

  <dd><i>/proc/self/fd/N</i> is approximately the same as <i>/dev/fd/N</i> in

  <dd>Note that for file descriptors referring to inodes (pipes and sockets, see

      distinct from those of the <i>/proc/[pid]/fd</i> entry, and that the owner

  <dd>This file can be used to adjust the badness heuristic used to select which
      process gets killed in out-of-memory conditions.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The badness heuristic assigns a value to each candidate task ranging from
      0 (never kill) to 1000 (always kill) to determine which process is
      targeted. The units are roughly a proportion along that range of allowed
      memory the process may allocate from, based on an estimation of its
      current memory and swap use. For example, if a task is using all allowed
      memory, its badness score will be 1000. If it is using half of its allowed
      memory, its score will be 500.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>There is an additional factor included in the badness score: root
      processes are given 3% extra memory over other tasks.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The amount of &quot;allowed&quot; memory depends on the context in which
      the OOM-killer was called. If it is due to the memory assigned to the
      allocating task's cpuset being exhausted, the allowed memory represents
      the set of mems assigned to that cpuset (see <b>cpuset</b>(7)). If it is
      due to a mempolicy's node(s) being exhausted, the allowed memory
      represents the set of mempolicy nodes. If it is due to a memory limit (or
      swap limit) being reached, the allowed memory is that configured limit.
      Finally, if it is due to the entire system being out of memory, the
      allowed memory represents all allocatable resources.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The value of <i>oom_score_adj</i> is added to the badness score before it
      is used to determine which task to kill. Acceptable values range from
      -1000 (OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MIN) to +1000 (OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MAX). This allows user
      space to control the preference for OOM-killing, ranging from always
      preferring a certain task or completely disabling it from OOM killing. The
      lowest possible value, -1000, is equivalent to disabling OOM-killing
      entirely for that task, since it will always report a badness score of
    0.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Consequently, it is very simple for user space to define the amount of
      memory to consider for each task. Setting an <i>oom_score_adj</i> value of
      +500, for example, is roughly equivalent to allowing the remainder of
      tasks sharing the same system, cpuset, mempolicy, or memory controller
      resources to use at least 50% more memory. A value of -500, on the other
      hand, would be roughly equivalent to discounting 50% of the task's allowed
      memory from being considered as scoring against the task.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>For backward compatibility with previous kernels,
      <i>/proc/[pid]/oom_adj</i> can still be used to tune the badness score.
      Its value is scaled linearly with <i>oom_score_adj</i>.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Writing to <i>/proc/[pid]/oom_score_adj</i> or <i>/proc/[pid]/oom_adj</i>
      will change the other with its scaled value.</dd>

  <dd>The first of these lines shows the same information as is displayed for
      the mapping in <i>/proc/[pid]/maps</i>. The following lines show the size
      of the mapping, the amount of the mapping that is currently resident in
      RAM (&quot;Rss&quot;), the process's proportional share of this mapping
      (&quot;Pss&quot;), the number of clean and dirty shared pages in the
      mapping, and the number of clean and dirty private pages in the mapping.
      &quot;Referenced&quot; indicates the amount of memory currently marked as
      referenced or accessed. &quot;Anonymous&quot; shows the amount of memory
      that does not belong to any file. &quot;Swap&quot; shows how much
      would-be-anonymous memory is also used, but out on swap.</dd>

  <dd>The &quot;KernelPageSize&quot; line (available since Linux 2.6.29) is the
      page size used by the kernel to back the virtual memory area. This matches
      the size used by the MMU in the majority of cases. However, one
      counter-example occurs on PPC64 kernels whereby a kernel using 64kB as a
      base page size may still use 4kB pages for the MMU on older processors. To
      distinguish the two attributes, the &quot;MMUPageSize&quot; line (also
      available since Linux 2.6.29) reports the page size used by the MMU.</dd>

      -2 to -100, corresponding to real-time priorities 1 to 99. For processes
      running under a non-real-time scheduling policy, this is the raw nice
      value (<b>setpriority</b>(2)) as represented in the kernel. The kernel
      stores nice values as numbers in the range 0 (high) to 39 (low),

  <dd>With the advent of network namespaces, various information relating to the

      <i>/proc/self/net</i>, which contains the same files and directories as

Many files contain strings (e.g., the environment and command line) that are in
  the internal format, with subfields terminated by null bytes ('\0'). When
  inspecting such files, you may find that the results are more readable if you
  use a command of the following form to display them:

$<b> cat <i>file</i> | tr '\000' '\n'</b>
