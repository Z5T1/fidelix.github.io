The OpenSSL CONF library can be used to read configuration files; see
  <a class="Xr" href="../man3/CONF_modules_load_file.3.html">CONF_modules_load_file(3)</a>.
  It is used for the OpenSSL master configuration file
  <span class="Pa">/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf</span> and in a few other places like
  <b class="Sy">SPKAC</b> files and certificate extension files for the
  <a class="Xr" href="../man1/openssl.1.html">openssl(1)</a>
  <code class="Cm">x509</code> utility. OpenSSL applications can also use the
  CONF library for their own purposes.
<p class="Pp">A configuration file is divided into a number of sections. Each
    section starts with a line [<var class="Ar">section_name</var>] and ends
    when a new section is started or the end of the file is reached. A section
    name can consist of alphanumeric characters and underscores.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first section of a configuration file is special and is
    referred to as the &#x201C;default section&#x201D;. It is usually unnamed
    and extends from the start of file to the first named section. When a name
    is being looked up, it is first looked up in a named section (if any) and
    then in the default section.</p>
<p class="Pp">The environment is mapped onto a section called
    <code class="Ic">ENV</code>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Comments can be included by preceding them with the
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">#</code>&#x2019; character.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each section in a configuration file consists of a number of name
    and value pairs of the form
    <var class="Ar">name</var>=<var class="Ar">value</var>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <var class="Ar">name</var> string can contain any alphanumeric
    characters as well as a few punctuation symbols such as
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">.</code>&#x2019;
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">,</code>&#x2019;
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">;</code>&#x2019; and
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">_</code>&#x2019;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <var class="Ar">value</var> string consists of the string
    following the &#x2018;<code class="Li">=</code>&#x2019; character until the
    end of the line with any leading and trailing whitespace removed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The value string undergoes variable expansion. This can be done by
    including substrings of the form $<var class="Ar">name</var> or
    ${<var class="Ar">name</var>}: this will substitute the value of the named
    variable in the current section. It is also possible to substitute a value
    from another section using the syntax
    $<var class="Ar">section</var>::<var class="Ar">name</var> or
    ${<var class="Ar">section</var>::<var class="Ar">name</var>}. By using the
    form $<code class="Ic">ENV</code>::<var class="Ar">name</var>, environment
    variables can be substituted. It is also possible to assign values to
    environment variables by using the name
    <code class="Ic">ENV</code>::<var class="Ar">name</var>. This will work if
    the program looks up environment variables using the CONF library instead of
    calling <a class="Xr" href="../man3/getenv.3.html">getenv(3)</a>
  directly.</p>
<p class="Pp">It is possible to escape certain characters by using any kind of
    quote or the &#x2018;<code class="Li">\</code>&#x2019; character. By making
    the last character of a line a &#x2018;<code class="Li">\</code>&#x2019;, a
    <var class="Ar">value</var> string can be spread across multiple lines. In
    addition the sequences &#x2018;<code class="Li">\n</code>&#x2019;,
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">\r</code>&#x2019;,
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">\b</code>&#x2019;, and
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">\t</code>&#x2019; are recognized.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="OPENSSL_LIBRARY_CONFIGURATION"><a class="permalink" href="#OPENSSL_LIBRARY_CONFIGURATION">OPENSSL
  LIBRARY CONFIGURATION</a></h1>
Applications can automatically configure certain aspects of OpenSSL using the
  master OpenSSL configuration file, or optionally an alternative configuration
  file. The <a class="Xr" href="../man1/openssl.1.html">openssl(1)</a> utility
  includes this functionality: any sub command uses the master OpenSSL
  configuration file unless an option is used in the sub command to use an
  alternative configuration file.
<p class="Pp">To enable library configuration, the default section needs to
    contain an appropriate line which points to the main configuration section.
    The default name is <code class="Ic">openssl_conf</code>, which is used by
    the <a class="Xr" href="../man1/openssl.1.html">openssl(1)</a> utility.
    Other applications may use an alternative name such as
    <b class="Sy">myapplication_conf</b>. All library configuration lines appear
    in the default section at the start of the configuration file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The configuration section should consist of a set of name value
    pairs which contain specific module configuration information. The
    <var class="Ar">name</var> represents the name of the configuration module.
    The meaning of the <var class="Ar">value</var> is module specific: it may,
    for example, represent a further configuration section containing
    configuration module specific information. For example:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">
<pre>
# The following line must be in the default section.
openssl_conf = openssl_init

[openssl_init]
oid_section = new_oids
engines = engine_section

[new_oids]
... new oids here ...

[engine_section]
... engine stuff here ...
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The features of each configuration module are described below.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="ASN1_Object_Configuration_Module"><a class="permalink" href="#ASN1_Object_Configuration_Module">ASN1
  Object Configuration Module</a></h2>
This module has the name <code class="Ic">oid_section</code>. The value of this
  variable points to a section containing name value pairs of OIDs: the name is
  the OID short and long name, and the value is the numerical form of the OID.
  Although some of the
  <a class="Xr" href="../man1/openssl.1.html">openssl(1)</a> utility subcommands
  already have their own ASN1 OBJECT section functionality, not all do. By using
  the ASN1 OBJECT configuration module, all the
  <a class="Xr" href="../man1/openssl.1.html">openssl(1)</a> utility subcommands
  can see the new objects as well as any compliant applications. For example:
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">
<pre>
[new_oids]
some_new_oid = 1.2.3.4
some_other_oid = 1.2.3.5
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">It is also possible to set the value to the long name followed by
    a comma and the numerical OID form. For example:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">shortName = some object long name,
  1.2.3.4</code></div>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Engine_Configuration_Module"><a class="permalink" href="#Engine_Configuration_Module">Engine
  Configuration Module</a></h2>
This ENGINE configuration module has the name <code class="Ic">engines</code>.
  The value of this variable points to a section containing further ENGINE
  configuration information.
<p class="Pp">The section pointed to by <code class="Ic">engines</code> is a
    table of engine names (though see <code class="Ic">engine_id</code> below)
    and further sections containing configuration information specific to each
    ENGINE.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each ENGINE specific section is used to set default algorithms,
    load dynamic ENGINEs, perform initialization and send ctrls. The actual
    operation performed depends on the command name which is the name of the
    name value pair. The currently supported commands are listed below.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">
<pre>
[engine_section]
# Configure ENGINE named &quot;foo&quot;
foo = foo_section
# Configure ENGINE named &quot;bar&quot;
bar = bar_section

[foo_section]
... foo ENGINE specific commands ...

[bar_section]
... &quot;bar&quot; ENGINE specific commands ...
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The command <code class="Ic">engine_id</code> is used to give the
    ENGINE name. If used this command must be first. For example:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">
<pre>
[engine_section]
# This would normally handle an ENGINE named &quot;foo&quot;
foo = foo_section

[foo_section]
# Override default name and use &quot;myfoo&quot; instead.
engine_id = myfoo
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The command <code class="Ic">dynamic_path</code> loads and adds an
    ENGINE from the given path. It is equivalent to sending the ctrls
    <b class="Sy">SO_PATH</b> with the path argument followed by
    <b class="Sy">LIST_ADD</b> with value 2 and <b class="Sy">LOAD</b> to the
    dynamic ENGINE. If this is not the required behaviour then alternative ctrls
    can be sent directly to the dynamic ENGINE using ctrl commands.</p>
<p class="Pp">The command <code class="Ic">init</code> determines whether to
    initialize the ENGINE. If the value is 0, the ENGINE will not be
    initialized. If it is 1, an attempt is made to initialized the ENGINE
    immediately. If the <code class="Ic">init</code> command is not present,
    then an attempt will be made to initialize the ENGINE after all commands in
    its section have been processed.</p>
<p class="Pp">The command <code class="Ic">default_algorithms</code> sets the
    default algorithms an ENGINE will supply using the functions
    <a class="Xr" href="../man3/ENGINE_set_default_string.3.html">ENGINE_set_default_string(3)</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the name matches none of the above command names it is assumed
    to be a ctrl command which is sent to the ENGINE. The value of the command
    is the argument to the ctrl command. If the value is the string
    <code class="Cm">EMPTY</code>, then no value is sent to the command.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">
<pre>
[engine_section]
# Configure ENGINE named &quot;foo&quot;
foo = foo_section

[foo_section]
# Load engine from DSO
dynamic_path = /some/path/fooengine.so
# A foo specific ctrl.
some_ctrl = some_value
# Another ctrl that doesn't take a value.
other_ctrl = EMPTY
# Supply all default algorithms
default_algorithms = ALL

Here is a sample configuration file using some of the features mentioned above:
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">
<pre>
# This is the default section.
HOME=/temp
RANDFILE= ${ENV::HOME}/.rnd
configdir=$ENV::HOME/config

[ section_one ]
# We are now in section one.

# Quotes permit leading and trailing whitespace
any = &quot; any variable name &quot;

other = A string that can \
cover several lines \
by including \\ characters

message = Hello World\n

[ section_two ]
greeting = $section_one::message
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">This next example shows how to expand environment variables
    safely.</p>
<p class="Pp">Suppose you want a variable called <b class="Sy">tmpfile</b> to
    refer to a temporary filename. The directory it is placed in can determined
    by the <code class="Ev">TEMP</code> or <code class="Ev">TMP</code>
    environment variables but they may not be set to any value at all. If you
    just include the environment variable names and the variable doesn't exist
    then this will cause an error when an attempt is made to load the
    configuration file. By making use of the default section both values can be
    looked up with <code class="Ev">TEMP</code> taking priority and
    <span class="Pa">/tmp</span> used if neither is defined:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">
<pre>
TMP=/tmp
# The above value is used if TMP isn't in the environment
TEMP=$ENV::TMP
# The above value is used if TEMP isn't in the environment
tmpfile=${ENV::TEMP}/tmp.filename
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">More complex OpenSSL library configuration. Add OID:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">
<pre>
# Default appname: should match &quot;appname&quot; parameter (if any)
# supplied to CONF_modules_load_file et al.
openssl_conf = openssl_conf_section

[openssl_conf_section]
# Configuration module list
alg_section = evp_sect
oid_section = new_oids

[new_oids]
# New OID, just short name
newoid1 = 1.2.3.4.1
# New OID shortname and long name
newoid2 = New OID 2 long name, 1.2.3.4.2
</pre>
</div>
<p class="Pp">The above examples can be used with any application supporting
    library configuration if &quot;openssl_conf&quot; is modified to match the
    appropriate &quot;appname&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">For example if the second sample file above is saved to
    &quot;example.cnf&quot; then the command line:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">OPENSSL_CONF=example.cnf openssl
  asn1parse -genstr OID:1.2.3.4.1</code></div>
<p class="Pp">will output:</p>
<div class="Bd Bd-indent"><code class="Li">0:d=0 hl=2 l= 4 prim: OBJECT
  :newoid1</code></div>
<p class="Pp">showing that the OID &quot;newoid1&quot; has been added as
    &quot;1.2.3.4.1&quot;.</p>

If a configuration file attempts to expand a variable that doesn't exist, then
  an error is flagged and the file will not load. This can also happen if an
  attempt is made to expand an environment variable that doesn't exist. For
  example, in a previous version of OpenSSL the default OpenSSL master
  configuration file used the value of <code class="Ev">HOME</code> which may
  not be defined on non Unix systems and would cause an error.
<p class="Pp">This can be worked around by including a default section to
    provide a default value: then if the environment lookup fails, the default
    value will be used instead. For this to work properly, the default value
    must be defined earlier in the configuration file than the expansion. See
    the <a class="Sx" href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a> section for an example of
    how to do this.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the same variable is defined more than once in the same
    section, then all but the last value will be silently ignored. In certain
    circumstances such as with DNs, the same field may occur multiple times.
    This is usually worked around by ignoring any characters before an initial
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">.</code>&#x2019;, for example:</p>
<div class="Bd Pp Bd-indent">
<pre>
1.OU=&quot;My first OU&quot;
2.OU=&quot;My Second OU&quot;
</pre>
</div>
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="BUGS"><a class="permalink" href="#BUGS">BUGS</a></h1>
Currently there is no way to include characters using the octal
  \<var class="Ar">nnn</var> form. Strings are all NUL terminated, so NUL bytes
  cannot form part of the value.
<p class="Pp">The escaping isn't quite right: if you want to use sequences like
    &#x2018;<code class="Li">\n</code>&#x2019;, you can't use any quote escaping
    on the same line.</p>
<p class="Pp">Files are loaded in a single pass. This means that a variable
    expansion will only work if the variables referenced are defined earlier in
    the file.</p>
