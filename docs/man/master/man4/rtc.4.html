This is the interface to drivers for real-time clocks (RTCs).
<p class="Pp">Most computers have one or more hardware clocks which record the
    current &quot;wall clock&quot; time. These are called &quot;Real Time
    Clocks&quot; (RTCs). One of these usually has battery backup power so that
    it tracks the time even while the computer is turned off. RTCs often provide
    alarms and other interrupts.</p>
<p class="Pp">All i386 PCs, and ACPI-based systems, have an RTC that is
    compatible with the Motorola MC146818 chip on the original PC/AT. Today such
    an RTC is usually integrated into the mainboard's chipset (south bridge),
    and uses a replaceable coin-sized backup battery.</p>
<p class="Pp">Non-PC systems, such as embedded systems built around
    system-on-chip processors, use other implementations. They usually won't
    offer the same functionality as the RTC from a PC/AT.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="RTC_vs_system_clock"><a class="permalink" href="#RTC_vs_system_clock">RTC
  vs system clock</a></h2>
RTCs should not be confused with the system clock, which is a software clock
  maintained by the kernel and used to implement <b>gettimeofday</b>(2) and
  <b>time</b>(2), as well as setting timestamps on files, and so on. The system
  clock reports seconds and microseconds since a start point, defined to be the
  POSIX Epoch: 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC). (One common implementation
  counts timer interrupts, once per &quot;jiffy&quot;, at a frequency of 100,
  250, or 1000 Hz.) That is, it is supposed to report wall clock time, which
  RTCs also do.
<p class="Pp">A key difference between an RTC and the system clock is that RTCs
    run even when the system is in a low power state (including
    &quot;off&quot;), and the system clock can't. Until it is initialized, the
    system clock can only report time since system boot ... not since the POSIX
    Epoch. So at boot time, and after resuming from a system low power state,
    the system clock will often be set to the current wall clock time using an
    RTC. Systems without an RTC need to set the system clock using another
    clock, maybe across the network or by entering that data manually.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="RTC_functionality"><a class="permalink" href="#RTC_functionality">RTC
  functionality</a></h2>
RTCs can be read and written with <b>hwclock</b>(8), or directly with the ioctl
  requests listed below.
<p class="Pp">Besides tracking the date and time, many RTCs can also generate
    interrupts</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>on every clock update (i.e., once per second);</li>
  <li>at periodic intervals with a frequency that can be set to any power-of-2
      multiple in the range 2 Hz to 8192 Hz;</li>
  <li>on reaching a previously specified alarm time.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Each of those interrupt sources can be enabled or disabled
    separately. On many systems, the alarm interrupt can be configured as a
    system wakeup event, which can resume the system from a low power state such
    as Suspend-to-RAM (STR, called S3 in ACPI systems), Hibernation (called S4
    in ACPI systems), or even &quot;off&quot; (called S5 in ACPI systems). On
    some systems, the battery backed RTC can't issue interrupts, but another one
    can.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>/dev/rtc</i> (or <i>/dev/rtc0</i>, <i>/dev/rtc1</i>, etc.)
    device can be opened only once (until it is closed) and it is read-only. On
    <b>read</b>(2) and <b>select</b>(2) the calling process is blocked until the
    next interrupt from that RTC is received. Following the interrupt, the
    process can read a long integer, of which the least significant byte
    contains a bit mask encoding the types of interrupt that occurred, while the
    remaining 3 bytes contain the number of interrupts since the last
    <b>read</b>(2).</p>

  <dt><b>RTC_ALM_READ</b>, <b>RTC_ALM_SET</b></dt>
  <dd>Read and set the alarm time, for RTCs that support alarms. The alarm
      interrupt must be separately enabled or disabled using the
      <b>RTC_AIE_ON</b>, <b>RTC_AIE_OFF</b> requests. The third <b>ioctl</b>(2)
      argument is a pointer to an <i>rtc_time</i> structure. Only the

  <dt><b>RTC_IRQP_READ</b>, <b>RTC_IRQP_SET</b></dt>

      third <b>ioctl</b>(2) argument is an <i>unsigned long&#x00A0;*</i> or an
      <i>unsigned long</i>, respectively. The value is the frequency in
      interrupts per second. The set of allowable frequencies is the multiples
      of two in the range 2 to 8192. Only a privileged process (i.e., one having
      the <b>CAP_SYS_RESOURCE</b> capability) can set frequencies above the

      to 1900 on most systems but on Alpha and MIPS it might also be initialized
      to 1952, 1980, or 2000, depending on the value of an RTC register for the
      year. With some RTCs, these operations can be used to read or to set the
      RTC's Epoch, respectively. The third <b>ioctl</b>(2) argument is an
      <i>unsigned long&#x00A0;*</i> or an <i>unsigned long</i>, respectively,

  <dd>The <i>enabled</i> flag is used to enable or disable the alarm interrupt,
      or to read its current status; when using these calls, <b>RTC_AIE_ON</b>

      <b>RTC_WKALM_RD</b> to report a pending interrupt (so it's mostly useless
      on Linux, except when talking to the RTC managed by EFI firmware). The

When the kernel's system time is synchronized with an external reference using
  <b>adjtimex</b>(2) it will update a designated RTC periodically every 11
  minutes. To do so, the kernel has to briefly turn off periodic interrupts;
  this might affect programs using that RTC.
<p class="Pp">An RTC's Epoch has nothing to do with the POSIX Epoch which is
    used only for the system clock.</p>
<p class="Pp">If the year according to the RTC's Epoch and the year register is
    less than 1970 it is assumed to be 100 years later, that is, between 2000
    and 2069.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some RTCs support &quot;wildcard&quot; values in alarm fields, to
    support scenarios like periodic alarms at fifteen minutes after every hour,
    or on the first day of each month. Such usage is nonportable; portable
    user-space code expects only a single alarm interrupt, and will either
    disable or reinitialize the alarm after receiving it.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some RTCs support periodic interrupts with periods that are
    multiples of a second rather than fractions of a second; multiple alarms;
    programmable output clock signals; nonvolatile memory; and other hardware
    capabilities that are not currently exposed by this API.</p>
