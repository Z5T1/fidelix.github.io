For an overview of namespaces, see <b>namespaces</b>(7).
<p class="Pp">User namespaces isolate security-related identifiers and
    attributes, in particular, user IDs and group IDs (see
    <b>credentials</b>(7)), the root directory, keys (see <b>keyrings</b>(7)),
    and capabilities (see <b>capabilities</b>(7)). A process's user and group
    IDs can be different inside and outside a user namespace. In particular, a
    process can have a normal unprivileged user ID outside a user namespace
    while at the same time having a user ID of 0 inside the namespace; in other
    words, the process has full privileges for operations inside the user
    namespace, but is unprivileged for operations outside the namespace.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Nested_namespaces,_namespace_membership"><a class="permalink" href="#Nested_namespaces,_namespace_membership">Nested
  namespaces, namespace membership</a></h2>
User namespaces can be nested; that is, each user namespace&#x2014;except the
  initial (&quot;root&quot;) namespace&#x2014;has a parent user namespace, and
  can have zero or more child user namespaces. The parent user namespace is the
  user namespace of the process that creates the user namespace via a call to
  <b>unshare</b>(2) or <b>clone</b>(2) with the <b>CLONE_NEWUSER</b> flag.
<p class="Pp">The kernel imposes (since version 3.11) a limit of 32 nested
    levels of user namespaces. Calls to <b>unshare</b>(2) or <b>clone</b>(2)
    that would cause this limit to be exceeded fail with the error
    <b>EUSERS</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each process is a member of exactly one user namespace. A process
    created via <b>fork</b>(2) or <b>clone</b>(2) without the
    <b>CLONE_NEWUSER</b> flag is a member of the same user namespace as its
    parent. A single-threaded process can join another user namespace with
    <b>setns</b>(2) if it has the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> in that namespace; upon
    doing so, it gains a full set of capabilities in that namespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">A call to <b>clone</b>(2) or <b>unshare</b>(2) with the
    <b>CLONE_NEWUSER</b> flag makes the new child process (for <b>clone</b>(2))
    or the caller (for <b>unshare</b>(2)) a member of the new user namespace
    created by the call.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>NS_GET_PARENT</b> <b>ioctl</b>(2) operation can be used to
    discover the parental relationship between user namespaces; see
    <b>ioctl_ns</b>(2).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Capabilities"><a class="permalink" href="#Capabilities">Capabilities</a></h2>
The child process created by <b>clone</b>(2) with the <b>CLONE_NEWUSER</b> flag
  starts out with a complete set of capabilities in the new user namespace.
  Likewise, a process that creates a new user namespace using <b>unshare</b>(2)
  or joins an existing user namespace using <b>setns</b>(2) gains a full set of
  capabilities in that namespace. On the other hand, that process has no
  capabilities in the parent (in the case of <b>clone</b>(2)) or previous (in
  the case of <b>unshare</b>(2) and <b>setns</b>(2)) user namespace, even if the
  new namespace is created or joined by the root user (i.e., a process with user
  ID 0 in the root namespace).
<p class="Pp">Note that a call to <b>execve</b>(2) will cause a process's
    capabilities to be recalculated in the usual way (see
    <b>capabilities</b>(7)). Consequently, unless the process has a user ID of 0
    within the namespace, or the executable file has a nonempty inheritable
    capabilities mask, the process will lose all capabilities. See the
    discussion of user and group ID mappings, below.</p>
<p class="Pp">A call to <b>clone</b>(2), <b>unshare</b>(2), or <b>setns</b>(2)
    using the <b>CLONE_NEWUSER</b> flag sets the &quot;securebits&quot; flags
    (see <b>capabilities</b>(7)) to their default values (all flags disabled) in
    the child (for <b>clone</b>(2)) or caller (for <b>unshare</b>(2), or
    <b>setns</b>(2)). Note that because the caller no longer has capabilities in
    its original user namespace after a call to <b>setns</b>(2), it is not
    possible for a process to reset its &quot;securebits&quot; flags while
    retaining its user namespace membership by using a pair of <b>setns</b>(2)
    calls to move to another user namespace and then return to its original user
    namespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">The rules for determining whether or not a process has a
    capability in a particular user namespace are as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>A process has a capability inside a user namespace if it is a member of
      that namespace and it has the capability in its effective capability set.
      A process can gain capabilities in its effective capability set in various
      ways. For example, it may execute a set-user-ID program or an executable
      with associated file capabilities. In addition, a process may gain
      capabilities via the effect of <b>clone</b>(2), <b>unshare</b>(2), or
      <b>setns</b>(2), as already described.</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>If a process has a capability in a user namespace, then it has that
      capability in all child (and further removed descendant) namespaces as
      well.</dd>
  <dt>3.</dt>
  <dd>When a user namespace is created, the kernel records the effective user ID
      of the creating process as being the &quot;owner&quot; of the namespace. A
      process that resides in the parent of the user namespace and whose
      effective user ID matches the owner of the namespace has all capabilities
      in the namespace. By virtue of the previous rule, this means that the
      process has all capabilities in all further removed descendant user
      namespaces as well. The <b>NS_GET_OWNER_UID</b> <b>ioctl</b>(2) operation
      can be used to discover the user ID of the owner of the namespace; see
      <b>ioctl_ns</b>(2).</dd>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Effect_of_capabilities_within_a_user_namespace"><a class="permalink" href="#Effect_of_capabilities_within_a_user_namespace">Effect
  of capabilities within a user namespace</a></h2>
Having a capability inside a user namespace permits a process to perform
  operations (that require privilege) only on resources governed by that
  namespace. In other words, having a capability in a user namespace permits a
  process to perform privileged operations on resources that are governed by
  (nonuser) namespaces owned by (associated with) the user namespace (see the
  next subsection).
<p class="Pp">On the other hand, there are many privileged operations that
    affect resources that are not associated with any namespace type, for
    example, changing the system time (governed by <b>CAP_SYS_TIME</b>), loading
    a kernel module (governed by <b>CAP_SYS_MODULE</b>), and creating a device
    (governed by <b>CAP_MKNOD</b>). Only a process with privileges in the
    <i>initial</i> user namespace can perform such operations.</p>
<p class="Pp">Holding <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> within the user namespace that owns a
    process's mount namespace allows that process to create bind mounts and
    mount the following types of filesystems:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><i>/proc</i> (since Linux 3.8)</li>
  <li><i>/sys</i> (since Linux 3.8)</li>

  <li><b>tmpfs</b>(5) (since Linux 3.9)</li>
  <li><i>ramfs</i> (since Linux 3.9)</li>
  <li><i>mqueue</i> (since Linux 3.9)</li>
  <li><i>bpf</i> (since Linux 4.4)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="Pp">Holding <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> within the user namespace that owns a
    process's cgroup namespace allows (since Linux 4.6) that process to the
    mount the cgroup version 2 filesystem and cgroup version 1 named hierarchies
    (i.e., cgroup filesystems mounted with the <i>&quot;none,name=&quot;</i>
    option).</p>
<p class="Pp">Holding <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> within the user namespace that owns a
    process's PID namespace allows (since Linux 3.8) that process to mount
    <i>/proc</i> filesystems.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note however, that mounting block-based filesystems can be done
    only by a process that holds <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> in the initial user
    namespace.</p>

  of user namespaces and other types of namespaces</a></h2>
Starting in Linux 3.8, unprivileged processes can create user namespaces, and
  the other types of namespaces can be created with just the
  <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> capability in the caller's user namespace.
<p class="Pp">When a nonuser namespace is created, it is owned by the user
    namespace in which the creating process was a member at the time of the
    creation of the namespace. Privileged operations on resources governed by
    the nonuser namespace require that the process has the necessary
    capabilities in the user namespace that owns the nonuser namespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">If <b>CLONE_NEWUSER</b> is specified along with other
    <b>CLONE_NEW*</b> flags in a single <b>clone</b>(2) or <b>unshare</b>(2)
    call, the user namespace is guaranteed to be created first, giving the child
    (<b>clone</b>(2)) or caller (<b>unshare</b>(2)) privileges over the
    remaining namespaces created by the call. Thus, it is possible for an
    unprivileged caller to specify this combination of flags.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a new namespace (other than a user namespace) is created via
    <b>clone</b>(2) or <b>unshare</b>(2), the kernel records the user namespace
    of the creating process as the owner of the new namespace. (This association
    can't be changed.) When a process in the new namespace subsequently performs
    privileged operations that operate on global resources isolated by the
    namespace, the permission checks are performed according to the process's
    capabilities in the user namespace that the kernel associated with the new
    namespace. For example, suppose that a process attempts to change the
    hostname (<b>sethostname</b>(2)), a resource governed by the UTS namespace.
    In this case, the kernel will determine which user namespace owns the
    process's UTS namespace, and check whether the process has the required
    capability (<b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b>) in that user namespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>NS_GET_USERNS</b> <b>ioctl</b>(2) operation can be used to
    discover the user namespace that owns a nonuser namespace; see
    <b>ioctl_ns</b>(2).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="User_and_group_ID_mappings:_uid_map_and_gid_map"><a class="permalink" href="#User_and_group_ID_mappings:_uid_map_and_gid_map">User
  and group ID mappings: uid_map and gid_map</a></h2>
When a user namespace is created, it starts out without a mapping of user IDs
  (group IDs) to the parent user namespace. The <i>/proc/[pid]/uid_map</i> and
  <i>/proc/[pid]/gid_map</i> files (available since Linux 3.5) expose the
  mappings for user and group IDs inside the user namespace for the process
  <i>pid</i>. These files can be read to view the mappings in a user namespace
  and written to (once) to define the mappings.
<p class="Pp">The description in the following paragraphs explains the details
    for <i>uid_map</i>; <i>gid_map</i> is exactly the same, but each instance of
    &quot;user ID&quot; is replaced by &quot;group ID&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>uid_map</i> file exposes the mapping of user IDs from the
    user namespace of the process <i>pid</i> to the user namespace of the
    process that opened <i>uid_map</i> (but see a qualification to this point
    below). In other words, processes that are in different user namespaces will
    potentially see different values when reading from a particular
    <i>uid_map</i> file, depending on the user ID mappings for the user
    namespaces of the reading processes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Each line in the <i>uid_map</i> file specifies a 1-to-1 mapping of
    a range of contiguous user IDs between two user namespaces. (When a user
    namespace is first created, this file is empty.) The specification in each
    line takes the form of three numbers delimited by white space. The first two
    numbers specify the starting user ID in each of the two user namespaces. The
    third number specifies the length of the mapped range. In detail, the fields
    are interpreted as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>(1)</dt>
  <dd>The start of the range of user IDs in the user namespace of the process
      <i>pid</i>.</dd>
  <dt>(2)</dt>
  <dd>The start of the range of user IDs to which the user IDs specified by
      field one map. How field two is interpreted depends on whether the process
      that opened <i>uid_map</i> and the process <i>pid</i> are in the same user
      namespace, as follows:</dd>
</dl>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>a)</dt>
  <dd>If the two processes are in different user namespaces: field two is the
      start of a range of user IDs in the user namespace of the process that
      opened <i>uid_map</i>.</dd>
  <dt>b)</dt>
  <dd>If the two processes are in the same user namespace: field two is the
      start of the range of user IDs in the parent user namespace of the process
      <i>pid</i>. This case enables the opener of <i>uid_map</i> (the common
      case here is opening <i>/proc/self/uid_map</i>) to see the mapping of user
      IDs into the user namespace of the process that created this user
      namespace.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>(3)</dt>
  <dd>The length of the range of user IDs that is mapped between the two user
      namespaces.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">System calls that return user IDs (group IDs)&#x2014;for example,
    <b>getuid</b>(2), <b>getgid</b>(2), and the credential fields in the
    structure returned by <b>stat</b>(2)&#x2014;return the user ID (group ID)
    mapped into the caller's user namespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">When a process accesses a file, its user and group IDs are mapped
    into the initial user namespace for the purpose of permission checking and
    assigning IDs when creating a file. When a process retrieves file user and
    group IDs via <b>stat</b>(2), the IDs are mapped in the opposite direction,
    to produce values relative to the process user and group ID mappings.</p>
<p class="Pp">The initial user namespace has no parent namespace, but, for
    consistency, the kernel provides dummy user and group ID mapping files for
    this namespace. Looking at the <i>uid_map</i> file (<i>gid_map</i> is the
    same) from a shell in the initial namespace shows:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>cat /proc/$$/uid_map</b>
         0          0 4294967295

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">This mapping tells us that the range starting at user ID 0 in this
    namespace maps to a range starting at 0 in the (nonexistent) parent
    namespace, and the length of the range is the largest 32-bit unsigned
    integer. This leaves 4294967295 (the 32-bit signed -1 value) unmapped. This
    is deliberate: <i>(uid_t)&#x00A0;-1</i> is used in several interfaces (e.g.,
    <b>setreuid</b>(2)) as a way to specify &quot;no user ID&quot;. Leaving
    <i>(uid_t)&#x00A0;-1</i> unmapped and unusable guarantees that there will be
    no confusion when using these interfaces.</p>

  user and group ID mappings: writing to uid_map and gid_map</a></h2>
After the creation of a new user namespace, the <i>uid_map</i> file of
  <i>one</i> of the processes in the namespace may be written to <i>once</i> to
  define the mapping of user IDs in the new user namespace. An attempt to write
  more than once to a <i>uid_map</i> file in a user namespace fails with the
  error <b>EPERM</b>. Similar rules apply for <i>gid_map</i> files.
<p class="Pp">The lines written to <i>uid_map</i> (<i>gid_map</i>) must conform
    to the following rules:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The three fields must be valid numbers, and the last field must be greater
      than 0.</li>
  <li>Lines are terminated by newline characters.</li>
  <li>There is a limit on the number of lines in the file. In Linux 4.14 and
      earlier, this limit was (arbitrarily) set at 5 lines. Since Linux 4.15,
      the limit is 340 lines. In addition, the number of bytes written to the
      file must be less than the system page size, and the write must be
      performed at the start of the file (i.e., <b>lseek</b>(2) and
      <b>pwrite</b>(2) can't be used to write to nonzero offsets in the
    file).</li>
  <li>The range of user IDs (group IDs) specified in each line cannot overlap
      with the ranges in any other lines. In the initial implementation (Linux
      3.8), this requirement was satisfied by a simplistic implementation that
      imposed the further requirement that the values in both field 1 and field
      2 of successive lines must be in ascending numerical order, which
      prevented some otherwise valid maps from being created. Linux 3.9 and
      later fix this limitation, allowing any valid set of nonoverlapping
    maps.</li>
  <li>At least one line must be written to the file.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Writes that violate the above rules fail with the error

The <i>/proc/[pid]/setgroups</i> file displays the string
  &quot;<i>allow</i>&quot; if processes in the user namespace that contains the
  process <i>pid</i> are permitted to employ the <b>setgroups</b>(2) system
  call; it displays &quot;<i>deny</i>&quot; if <b>setgroups</b>(2) is not

<p class="Pp">A privileged process (one with the <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> capability

    mapping for this user namespace to the file <i>/proc/[pid]/gid_map</i>.
    Writing the string &quot;<i>deny</i>&quot; prevents any process in the user

<p class="Pp">The essence of the restrictions described in the preceding
    paragraph is that it is permitted to write to <i>/proc/[pid]/setgroups</i>
    only so long as calling <b>setgroups</b>(2) is disallowed because

    in this user namespace. (Attempts to do so fail with the error
    <b>EPERM</b>.) This restriction also propagates down to all child user
    namespaces of this user namespace.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>/proc/[pid]/setgroups</i> file was added in Linux 3.19, but
    was backported to many earlier stable kernel series, because it addresses a
    security issue. The issue concerned files with permissions such as
    &quot;rwx---rwx&quot;. Such files give fewer permissions to
    &quot;group&quot; than they do to &quot;other&quot;. This means that
    dropping groups using <b>setgroups</b>(2) might allow a process file access
    that it did not formerly have. Before the existence of user namespaces this
    was not a concern, since only a privileged process (one with the
    <b>CAP_SETGID</b> capability) could call <b>setgroups</b>(2). However, with
    the introduction of user namespaces, it became possible for an unprivileged
    process to create a new namespace in which the user had all privileges. This
    then allowed formerly unprivileged users to drop groups and thus gain file
    access that they did not previously have. The <i>/proc/[pid]/setgroups</i>
    file was added to address this security issue, by denying any pathway for an
    unprivileged process to drop groups with <b>setgroups</b>(2).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Unmapped_user_and_group_IDs"><a class="permalink" href="#Unmapped_user_and_group_IDs">Unmapped
  user and group IDs</a></h2>
There are various places where an unmapped user ID (group ID) may be exposed to
  user space. For example, the first process in a new user namespace may call
  <b>getuid</b>(2) before a user ID mapping has been defined for the namespace.
  In most such cases, an unmapped user ID is converted to the overflow user ID
  (group ID); the default value for the overflow user ID (group ID) is 65534.
  See the descriptions of <i>/proc/sys/kernel/overflowuid</i> and
  <i>/proc/sys/kernel/overflowgid</i> in <b>proc</b>(5).
<p class="Pp">The cases where unmapped IDs are mapped in this fashion include
    system calls that return user IDs (<b>getuid</b>(2), <b>getgid</b>(2), and
    similar), credentials passed over a UNIX domain socket, credentials returned
    by <b>stat</b>(2), <b>waitid</b>(2), and the System V IPC &quot;ctl&quot;
    <b>IPC_STAT</b> operations, credentials exposed by <i>/proc/[pid]/status</i>
    and the files in <i>/proc/sysvipc/*</i>, credentials returned via the
    <i>si_uid</i> field in the <i>siginfo_t</i> received with a signal (see
    <b>sigaction</b>(2)), credentials written to the process accounting file
    (see <b>acct</b>(5)), and credentials returned with POSIX message queue
    notifications (see <b>mq_notify</b>(3)).</p>
<p class="Pp">There is one notable case where unmapped user and group IDs are
    <i>not</i> converted to the corresponding overflow ID value. When viewing a
    <i>uid_map</i> or <i>gid_map</i> file in which there is no mapping for the
    second field, that field is displayed as 4294967295 (-1 as an unsigned
    integer).</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Accessing_files"><a class="permalink" href="#Accessing_files">Accessing
  files</a></h2>
In order to determine permissions when an unprivileged process accesses a file,
  the process credentials (UID, GID) and the file credentials are in effect
  mapped back to what they would be in the initial user namespace and then
  compared to determine the permissions that the process has on the file. The
  same is also of other objects that employ the credentials plus permissions
  mask accessibility model, such as System V IPC objects

<h2 class="Ss" id="Operation_of_file-related_capabilities"><a class="permalink" href="#Operation_of_file-related_capabilities">Operation
  of file-related capabilities</a></h2>
Certain capabilities allow a process to bypass various kernel-enforced
  restrictions when performing operations on files owned by other users or
  groups. These capabilities are: <b>CAP_CHOWN</b>, <b>CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE</b>,
  <b>CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH</b>, <b>CAP_FOWNER</b>, and <b>CAP_FSETID</b>.
<p class="Pp">Within a user namespace, these capabilities allow a process to
    bypass the rules if the process has the relevant capability over the file,
    meaning that:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>the process has the relevant effective capability in its user namespace;
      and</li>
  <li>the file's user ID and group ID both have valid mappings in the user
      namespace.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">The <b>CAP_FOWNER</b> capability is treated somewhat
    exceptionally: it allows a process to bypass the corresponding rules so long
    as at least the file's user ID has a mapping in the user namespace (i.e.,
    the file's group ID does not need to have a valid mapping).</p>

  and set-group-ID programs</a></h2>
When a process inside a user namespace executes a set-user-ID (set-group-ID)
  program, the process's effective user (group) ID inside the namespace is
  changed to whatever value is mapped for the user (group) ID of the file.
  However, if either the user <i>or</i> the group ID of the file has no mapping
  inside the namespace, the set-user-ID (set-group-ID) bit is silently ignored:
  the new program is executed, but the process's effective user (group) ID is
  left unchanged. (This mirrors the semantics of executing a set-user-ID or
  set-group-ID program that resides on a filesystem that was mounted with the
  <b>MS_NOSUID</b> flag, as described in <b>mount</b>(2).)

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Miscellaneous"><a class="permalink" href="#Miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</a></h2>
When a process's user and group IDs are passed over a UNIX domain socket to a
  process in a different user namespace (see the description of
  <b>SCM_CREDENTIALS</b> in <b>unix</b>(7)), they are translated into the
  corresponding values as per the receiving process's user and group ID
  mappings.

Namespaces are a Linux-specific feature.

<h1 class="Sh" id="NOTES"><a class="permalink" href="#NOTES">NOTES</a></h1>
Over the years, there have been a lot of features that have been added to the
  Linux kernel that have been made available only to privileged users because of
  their potential to confuse set-user-ID-root applications. In general, it
  becomes safe to allow the root user in a user namespace to use those features
  because it is impossible, while in a user namespace, to gain more privilege
  than the root user of a user namespace has.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Availability"><a class="permalink" href="#Availability">Availability</a></h2>
Use of user namespaces requires a kernel that is configured with the
  <b>CONFIG_USER_NS</b> option. User namespaces require support in a range of
  subsystems across the kernel. When an unsupported subsystem is configured into
  the kernel, it is not possible to configure user namespaces support.
<p class="Pp">As at Linux 3.8, most relevant subsystems supported user
    namespaces, but a number of filesystems did not have the infrastructure
    needed to map user and group IDs between user namespaces. Linux 3.9 added
    the required infrastructure support for many of the remaining unsupported
    filesystems (Plan 9 (9P), Andrew File System (AFS), Ceph, CIFS, CODA, NFS,
    and OCFS2). Linux 3.12 added support for the last of the unsupported major
    filesystems, XFS.</p>

The program below is designed to allow experimenting with user namespaces, as
  well as other types of namespaces. It creates namespaces as specified by
  command-line options and then executes a command inside those namespaces. The
  comments and <i>usage()</i> function inside the program provide a full
  explanation of the program. The following shell session demonstrates its use.
<p class="Pp">First, we look at the run-time environment:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>uname -rs</b>     # Need Linux 3.8 or later
Linux 3.8.0
$ <b>id -u</b>         # Running as unprivileged user
1000
$ <b>id -g</b>
1000

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">Now start a new shell in new user (<i>-U</i>), mount (<i>-m</i>),
    and PID (<i>-p</i>) namespaces, with user ID (<i>-M</i>) and group ID
    (<i>-G</i>) 1000 mapped to 0 inside the user namespace:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>./userns_child_exec -p -m -U -M '0 1000 1' -G '0 1000 1' bash</b>

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">The shell has PID 1, because it is the first process in the new
    PID namespace:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
bash$ <b>echo $$</b>
1

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">Mounting a new <i>/proc</i> filesystem and listing all of the
    processes visible in the new PID namespace shows that the shell can't see
    any processes outside the PID namespace:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
bash$ <b>mount -t proc proc /proc</b>
bash$ <b>ps ax</b>
  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
    1 pts/3    S      0:00 bash
   22 pts/3    R+     0:00 ps ax

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">Inside the user namespace, the shell has user and group ID 0, and
    a full set of permitted and effective capabilities:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
bash$ <b>cat /proc/$$/status | egrep '^[UG]id'</b>
