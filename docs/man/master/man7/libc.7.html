libc - overview of standard C libraries on Linux
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
The term &quot;libc&quot; is commonly used as a shorthand for the &quot;standard
  C library&quot;, a library of standard functions that can be used by all C
  programs (and sometimes by programs in other languages). Because of some
  history (see below), use of the term &quot;libc&quot; to refer to the standard
  C library is somewhat ambiguous on Linux.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="glibc"><a class="permalink" href="#glibc">glibc</a></h2>
By far the most widely used C library on Linux is the GNU C Library
  <a class="Lk" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/">http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/</a>,
  often referred to as <i>glibc</i>. This is the C library that is nowadays used
  in all major Linux distributions. It is also the C library whose details are
  documented in the relevant pages of the <i>man-pages</i> project (primarily in
  Section 3 of the manual). Documentation of glibc is also available in the
  glibc manual, available via the command <i>info libc</i>. Release 1.0 of glibc
  was made in September 1992. (There were earlier 0.x releases.) The next major
  release of glibc was 2.0, at the beginning of 1997.
<p class="Pp">The pathname <i>/lib/libc.so.6</i> (or something similar) is
    normally a symbolic link that points to the location of the glibc library,
    and executing this pathname will cause glibc to display various information
    about the version installed on your system.</p>

  libc</a></h2>
In the early to mid 1990s, there was for a while <i>Linux libc</i>, a fork of
  glibc 1.x created by Linux developers who felt that glibc development at the
  time was not sufficing for the needs of Linux. Often, this library was
  referred to (ambiguously) as just &quot;libc&quot;. Linux libc released major
  versions 2, 3, 4, and 5, as well as many minor versions of those releases.
  Linux libc4 was the last version to use the a.out binary format, and the first
  version to provide (primitive) shared library support. Linux libc 5 was the
  first version to support the ELF binary format; this version used the shared
  library soname <i>libc.so.5</i>. For a while, Linux libc was the standard C
  library in many Linux distributions.
<p class="Pp">However, notwithstanding the original motivations of the Linux
    libc effort, by the time glibc 2.0 was released (in 1997), it was clearly
    superior to Linux libc, and all major Linux distributions that had been
    using Linux libc soon switched back to glibc. To avoid any confusion with
    Linux libc versions, glibc 2.0 and later used the shared library soname
    <i>libc.so.6</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since the switch from Linux libc to glibc 2.0 occurred long ago,
    <i>man-pages</i> no longer takes care to document Linux libc details.
    Nevertheless, the history is visible in vestiges of information about Linux
    libc that remain in a few manual pages, in particular, references to
    <i>libc4</i> and <i>libc5</i>.</p>

There are various other less widely used C libraries for Linux. These libraries
  are generally smaller than glibc, both in terms of features and memory
  footprint, and often intended for building small binaries, perhaps targeted at
  development for embedded Linux systems. Among such libraries are
  <a class="Lk" href="http://www.uclibc.org/"><i>uClibc</i></a>,
  <a class="Lk" href="http://www.fefe.de/dietlibc/"><i>dietlibc</i></a>, and
  <a class="Lk" href="http://www.musl-libc.org/"><i>musl libc</i></a>. Details
  of these libraries are covered by the <i>man-pages</i> project, where they are
  known.
