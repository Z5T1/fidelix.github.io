nptl - Native POSIX Threads Library
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
NPTL (Native POSIX Threads Library) is the GNU C library POSIX threads
  implementation that is used on modern Linux systems.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="NPTL_and_signals"><a class="permalink" href="#NPTL_and_signals">NPTL
  and signals</a></h2>
NPTL makes internal use of the first two real-time signals (signal numbers 32
  and 33). One of these signals is used to support thread cancellation and POSIX
  timers (see <b>timer_create</b>(2)); the other is used as part of a mechanism
  that ensures all threads in a process always have the same UIDs and GIDs, as
  required by POSIX. These signals cannot be used in applications.
<p class="Pp">To prevent accidental use of these signals in applications, which
    might interfere with the operation of the NPTL implementation, various glibc
    library functions and system call wrapper functions attempt to hide these
    signals from applications, as follows:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><b>SIGRTMIN</b> is defined with the value 34 (rather than 32).</li>
  <li>The <b>sigwaitinfo</b>(2), <b>sigtimedwait</b>(2), and <b>sigwait</b>(3)
      interfaces silently ignore requests to wait for these two signals if they
      are specified in the signal set argument of these calls.</li>
  <li>The <b>sigprocmask</b>(2) and <b>pthread_sigmask</b>(3) interfaces
      silently ignore attempts to block these two signals.</li>
  <li>The <b>sigaction</b>(2), <b>pthread_kill</b>(3), and
      <b>pthread_sigqueue</b>(3) interfaces fail with the error <b>EINVAL</b>
      (indicating an invalid signal number) if these signals are specified.</li>
  <li><b>sigfillset</b>(3) does not include these two signals when it creates a
      full signal set.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="Ss" id="NPTL_and_process_credential_changes"><a class="permalink" href="#NPTL_and_process_credential_changes">NPTL
  and process credential changes</a></h2>
At the Linux kernel level, credentials (user and group IDs) are a per-thread
  attribute. However, POSIX requires that all of the POSIX threads in a process
  have the same credentials. To accommodate this requirement, the NPTL
  implementation wraps all of the system calls that change process credentials
  with functions that, in addition to invoking the underlying system call,
  arrange for all other threads in the process to also change their credentials.
<p class="Pp">The implementation of each of these system calls involves the use
    of a real-time signal that is sent (using <b>tgkill</b>(2)) to each of the
    other threads that must change its credentials. Before sending these
    signals, the thread that is changing credentials saves the new credential(s)
    and records the system call being employed in a global buffer. A signal
    handler in the receiving thread(s) fetches this information and then uses
    the same system call to change its credentials.</p>
<p class="Pp">Wrapper functions employing this technique are provided for
    <b>setgid</b>(2), <b>setuid</b>(2), <b>setegid</b>(2), <b>seteuid</b>(2),
    <b>setregid</b>(2), <b>setreuid</b>(2), <b>setresgid</b>(2),
    <b>setresuid</b>(2), and <b>setgroups</b>(2).</p>

POSIX says that any thread in any process with access to the memory containing a
  process-shared (<b>PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED</b>) mutex can operate on that
  mutex. However, on 64-bit x86 systems, the mutex definition for x86-64 is
  incompatible with the mutex definition for i386, meaning that 32-bit and
  64-bit binaries can't share mutexes on x86-64 systems.
