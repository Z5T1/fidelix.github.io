For an overview of namespaces, see <b>namespaces</b>(7).
<p class="Pp">Mount namespaces provide isolation of the list of mount points
    seen by the processes in each namespace instance. Thus, the processes in
    each of the mount namespace instances will see distinct single-directory
    hierarchies.</p>
<p class="Pp">The views provided by the <i>/proc/[pid]/mounts</i>,
    <i>/proc/[pid]/mountinfo</i>, and <i>/proc/[pid]/mountstats</i> files (all
    described in <b>proc</b>(5)) correspond to the mount namespace in which the
    process with the PID <i>[pid]</i> resides. (All of the processes that reside
    in the same mount namespace will see the same view in these files.)</p>
<p class="Pp">A new mount namespace is created using either <b>clone</b>(2) or
    <b>unshare</b>(2) with the <b>CLONE_NEWNS</b> flag. When a new mount
    namespace is created, its mount point list is initialized as follows:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>If the namespace is created using <b>clone</b>(2), the mount point list of
      the child's namespace is a copy of the mount point list in the parent's
      namespace.</li>
  <li>If the namespace is created using <b>unshare</b>(2), the mount point list
      of the new namespace is a copy of the mount point list in the caller's
      previous mount namespace.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Subsequent modifications to the mount point list (<b>mount</b>(2)
    and <b>umount</b>(2)) in either mount namespace will not (by default) affect
    the mount point list seen in the other namespace (but see the following
    discussion of shared subtrees).</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Restrictions_on_mount_namespaces"><a class="permalink" href="#Restrictions_on_mount_namespaces">Restrictions
  on mount namespaces</a></h2>
Note the following points with respect to mount namespaces:
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Each mount namespace has an owner user namespace. As explained above, when
      a new mount namespace is created, its mount point list is initialized as a
      copy of the mount point list of another mount namespace. If the new
      namespace and the namespace from which the mount point list was copied are
      owned by different user namespaces, then the new mount namespace is
      considered <i>less privileged</i>.</li>
  <li>When creating a less privileged mount namespace, shared mounts are reduced
      to slave mounts. (Shared and slave mounts are discussed below.) This
      ensures that mappings performed in less privileged mount namespaces will
      not propagate to more privileged mount namespaces.</li>
  <li>Mounts that come as a single unit from more privileged mount are locked
      together and may not be separated in a less privileged mount namespace.
      (The <b>unshare</b>(2) <b>CLONE_NEWNS</b> operation brings across all of
      the mounts from the original mount namespace as a single unit, and
      recursive mounts that propagate between mount namespaces propagate as a
      single unit.)</li>
  <li>The <b>mount</b>(2) flags <b>MS_RDONLY</b>, <b>MS_NOSUID</b>,
      <b>MS_NOEXEC</b>, and the &quot;atime&quot; flags (<b>MS_NOATIME</b>,
      <b>MS_NODIRATIME</b>, <b>MS_RELATIME</b>) settings become locked when
      propagated from a more privileged to a less privileged mount namespace,
      and may not be changed in the less privileged mount namespace.</li>
  <li>A file or directory that is a mount point in one namespace that is not a
      mount point in another namespace, may be renamed, unlinked, or removed
      (<b>rmdir</b>(2)) in the mount namespace in which it is not a mount point
      (subject to the usual permission checks). Consequently, the mount point is
      removed in the mount namespace where it was a mount point.</li>
</ul>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Previously (before Linux 3.18), attempting to unlink, rename, or remove a
      file or directory that was a mount point in another mount namespace would
      result in the error <b>EBUSY</b>. That behavior had technical problems of
      enforcement (e.g., for NFS) and permitted denial-of-service attacks
      against more privileged users. (i.e., preventing individual files from
      being updated by bind mounting on top of them).</dd>

<h1 class="Sh" id="SHARED_SUBTREES"><a class="permalink" href="#SHARED_SUBTREES">SHARED
  SUBTREES</a></h1>
After the implementation of mount namespaces was completed, experience showed
  that the isolation that they provided was, in some cases, too great. For
  example, in order to make a newly loaded optical disk available in all mount
  namespaces, a mount operation was required in each namespace. For this use
  case, and others, the shared subtree feature was introduced in Linux 2.6.15.
  This feature allows for automatic, controlled propagation of mount and unmount
  <i>events</i> between namespaces (or, more precisely, between the members of a
  <i>peer group</i> that are propagating events to one another).
<p class="Pp">Each mount point is marked (via <b>mount</b>(2)) as having one of
    the following <i>propagation types</i>:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>MS_SHARED</b></dt>
  <dd>This mount point shares events with members of a peer group. Mount and
      unmount events immediately under this mount point will propagate to the
      other mount points that are members of the peer group. <i>Propagation</i>
      here means that the same mount or unmount will automatically occur under
      all of the other mount points in the peer group. Conversely, mount and
      unmount events that take place under peer mount points will propagate to
      this mount point.</dd>
  <dt><b>MS_PRIVATE</b></dt>
  <dd>This mount point is private; it does not have a peer group. Mount and
      unmount events do not propagate into or out of this mount point.</dd>
  <dt><b>MS_SLAVE</b></dt>
  <dd>Mount and unmount events propagate into this mount point from a (master)
      shared peer group. Mount and unmount events under this mount point do not
      propagate to any peer.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Note that a mount point can be the slave of another peer group while at
      the same time sharing mount and unmount events with a peer group of which
      it is a member. (More precisely, one peer group can be the slave of
      another peer group.)</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>MS_UNBINDABLE</b></dt>
  <dd>This is like a private mount, and in addition this mount can't be bind
      mounted. Attempts to bind mount this mount (<b>mount</b>(2) with the
      <b>MS_BIND</b> flag) will fail.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>When a recursive bind mount (<b>mount</b>(2) with the <b>MS_BIND</b> and
      <b>MS_REC</b> flags) is performed on a directory subtree, any bind mounts
      within the subtree are automatically pruned (i.e., not replicated) when
      replicating that subtree to produce the target subtree.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">For a discussion of the propagation type assigned to a new mount,
    see NOTES.</p>
<p class="Pp">The propagation type is a per-mount-point setting; some mount
    points may be marked as shared (with each shared mount point being a member
    of a distinct peer group), while others are private (or slaved or
    unbindable).</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that a mount's propagation type determines whether mounts and
    unmounts of mount points <i>immediately under</i> the mount point are
    propagated. Thus, the propagation type does not affect propagation of events
    for grandchildren and further removed descendant mount points. What happens
    if the mount point itself is unmounted is determined by the propagation type
    that is in effect for the <i>parent</i> of the mount point.</p>
<p class="Pp">Members are added to a <i>peer group</i> when a mount point is
    marked as shared and either:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>the mount point is replicated during the creation of a new mount
      namespace; or</li>
  <li>a new bind mount is created from the mount point.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">In both of these cases, the new mount point joins the peer group
    of which the existing mount point is a member.</p>
<p class="Pp">A new peer group is also created when a child mount point is
    created under an existing mount point that is marked as shared. In this
    case, the new child mount point is also marked as shared and the resulting
    peer group consists of all the mount points that are replicated under the
    peers of parent mount.</p>
<p class="Pp">A mount ceases to be a member of a peer group when either the
    mount is explicitly unmounted, or when the mount is implicitly unmounted
    because a mount namespace is removed (because it has no more member
    processes).</p>
<p class="Pp">The propagation type of the mount points in a mount namespace can
    be discovered via the &quot;optional fields&quot; exposed in
    <i>/proc/[pid]/mountinfo</i>. (See <b>proc</b>(5) for details of this file.)
    The following tags can appear in the optional fields for a record in that
    file:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>shared:X</i></dt>
  <dd>This mount point is shared in peer group <i>X</i>. Each peer group has a
      unique ID that is automatically generated by the kernel, and all mount
      points in the same peer group will show the same ID. (These IDs are
      assigned starting from the value 1, and may be recycled when a peer group
      ceases to have any members.)</dd>
  <dt><i>master:X</i></dt>
  <dd>This mount is a slave to shared peer group <i>X</i>.</dd>
  <dt><i>propagate_from:X</i> (since Linux 2.6.26)</dt>
  <dd>This mount is a slave and receives propagation from shared peer group
      <i>X</i>. This tag will always appear in conjunction with a
      <i>master:X</i> tag. Here, <i>X</i> is the closest dominant peer group
      under the process's root directory. If <i>X</i> is the immediate master of
      the mount, or if there is no dominant peer group under the same root, then
      only the <i>master:X</i> field is present and not the
      <i>propagate_from:X</i> field. For further details, see below.</dd>
  <dt><i>unbindable</i></dt>
  <dd>This is an unbindable mount.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If none of the above tags is present, then this is a private
    mount.</p>

Suppose that on a terminal in the initial mount namespace, we mark one mount
  point as shared and another as private, and then view the mounts in
  <i>/proc/self/mountinfo</i>:
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
sh1# <b>mount --make-shared /mntS</b>
sh1# <b>mount --make-private /mntP</b>
sh1# <b>cat /proc/self/mountinfo | grep '/mnt' | sed 's/ - .*//'</b>
77 61 8:17 / /mntS rw,relatime shared:1
83 61 8:15 / /mntP rw,relatime

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">From the <i>/proc/self/mountinfo</i> output, we see that
    <i>/mntS</i> is a shared mount in peer group 1, and that <i>/mntP</i> has no
    optional tags, indicating that it is a private mount. The first two fields
    in each record in this file are the unique ID for this mount, and the mount
    ID of the parent mount. We can further inspect this file to see that the
    parent mount point of <i>/mntS</i> and <i>/mntP</i> is the root directory,
    <i>/</i>, which is mounted as private:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
sh1# <b>cat /proc/self/mountinfo | awk '$1 == 61' | sed 's/ - .*//'</b>
61 0 8:2 / / rw,relatime

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">On a second terminal, we create a new mount namespace where we run
    a second shell and inspect the mounts:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>

<p class="Pp">The new mount namespace received a copy of the initial mount
    namespace's mount points. These new mount points maintain the same
    propagation types, but have unique mount IDs. (The
    <i>--propagation&#x00A0;unchanged</i> option prevents <b>unshare</b>(1) from
    marking all mounts as private when creating a new mount namespace, which it
    does by default.)</p>
<p class="Pp">In the second terminal, we then create submounts under each of
    <i>/mntS</i> and <i>/mntP</i> and inspect the set-up:</p>

230 225 8:23 / /mntP/b rw,relatime

<br/>
<p class="Pp">From the above, it can be seen that <i>/mntS/a</i> was created as
    shared (inheriting this setting from its parent mount) and <i>/mntP/b</i>
    was created as a private mount.</p>
<p class="Pp">Returning to the first terminal and inspecting the set-up, we see
    that the new mount created under the shared mount point <i>/mntS</i>
    propagated to its peer mount (in the initial mount namespace), but the new
    mount created under the private mount point <i>/mntP</i> did not
  propagate:</p>

Making a mount point a slave allows it to receive propagated mount and unmount
  events from a master shared peer group, while preventing it from propagating
  events to that master. This is useful if we want to (say) receive a mount
  event when an optical disk is mounted in the master shared peer group (in
  another mount namespace), but want to prevent mount and unmount events under
  the slave mount from having side effects in other namespaces.
<p class="Pp">We can demonstrate the effect of slaving by first marking two
    mount points as shared in the initial mount namespace:</p>

One of the primary purposes of unbindable mounts is to avoid the &quot;mount
  point explosion&quot; problem when repeatedly performing bind mounts of a
  higher-level subtree at a lower-level mount point. The problem is illustrated
  by the following shell session.
<p class="Pp">Suppose we have a system with the following mount points:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
# <b>mount | awk '{print $1, $2, $3}'</b>
/dev/sda1 on /
/dev/sdb6 on /mntX
/dev/sdb7 on /mntY

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">Suppose furthermore that we wish to recursively bind mount the
    root directory under several users' home directories. We do this for the
    first user, and inspect the mount points:</p>
<p class="Pp">

<pre>
# <b>mount --rbind / /home/cecilia/</b>

/dev/sda1 on /home/cecilia
/dev/sdb6 on /home/cecilia/mntX
/dev/sdb7 on /home/cecilia/mntY

<p class="Pp">When we repeat this operation for the second user, we start to see
    the explosion problem:</p>

<p class="Pp">The mount explosion problem in the above scenario can be avoided
    by making each of the new mounts unbindable. The effect of doing this is
    that recursive mounts of the root directory will not replicate the
    unbindable mounts. We make such a mount for the first user:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
# <b>mount --rbind --make-unbindable / /home/cecilia</b>

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">Before going further, we show that unbindable mounts are indeed
    unbindable:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
# <b>mkdir /mntZ</b>
# <b>mount --bind /home/cecilia /mntZ</b>
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /home/cecilia,
       missing codepage or helper program, or other error
       In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try
       dmesg | tail or so.

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">Now we create unbindable recursive bind mounts for the other two
    users:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
# <b>mount --rbind --make-unbindable / /home/henry</b>
# <b>mount --rbind --make-unbindable / /home/otto</b>

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">Upon examining the list of mount points, we see there has been no
    explosion of mount points, because the unbindable mounts were not replicated
    under each user's directory:</p>
<p class="Pp">

The <i>propagate_from:X</i> tag is shown in the optional fields of a

  slave's immediate master (i.e., the pathname of the master is not reachable

<p class="Pp">In the following example, we first create a two-link master-slave

    (new) root directory of the process.</p>
<p class="Pp">First, we bind mount the root directory onto <i>/mnt</i> and then

267 40 8:2 /etc /tmp/etc ... shared:102

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">Initially, these two mount points are in the same peer group, but
    we then make the <i>/tmp/etc</i> a slave of <i>/mnt/etc</i>, and then make

<p class="Pp">

# <b>mount --make-shared /tmp/etc</b>

248 239 0:4 / /mnt/proc ... shared:5
267 40 8:2 /etc /tmp/etc ... shared:105 master:102

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">Then we bind mount <i>/tmp/etc</i> onto <i>/mnt/tmp/etc</i>.
    Again, the two mount points are initially in the same peer group, but we
    then make <i>/mnt/tmp/etc</i> a slave of <i>/tmp/etc</i>:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
# <b>mkdir -p /mnt/tmp/etc</b>
# <b>mount --bind /tmp/etc /mnt/tmp/etc</b>
# <b>mount --make-slave /mnt/tmp/etc</b>
# <b>cat /proc/self/mountinfo | egrep '/mnt|/tmp/' | sed 's/ - .*//'</b>

<p class="Pp">From the above, we see that <i>/mnt</i> is the master of the slave
    <i>/tmp/etc</i>, which in turn is the master of the slave
    <i>/mnt/tmp/etc</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">We then <b>chroot</b>(1) to the <i>/mnt</i> directory, which

<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
# <b>chroot /mnt</b>

<p class="Pp">When we examine the state of the mounts inside the chroot-ed

273 239 8:2 /etc /tmp/etc ... master:105 propagate_from:102

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">Above, we see that the mount with ID 273 is a slave whose master
    is the peer group 105. The mount point for that master is unreachable, and
    so a <i>propagate_from</i> tag is displayed, indicating that the closest
    dominant peer group (i.e., the nearest reachable mount in the slave chain)
    is the peer group with the ID 102 (corresponding to the <i>/mnt</i> mount
    point before the <b>chroot</b>(1) was performed.</p>

The propagation type assigned to a new mount point depends on the propagation
  type of the parent mount. If the mount point has a parent (i.e., it is a
  non-root mount point) and the propagation type of the parent is
  <b>MS_SHARED</b>, then the propagation type of the new mount is also
  <b>MS_SHARED</b>. Otherwise, the propagation type of the new mount is
  <b>MS_PRIVATE</b>.
<p class="Pp">Notwithstanding the fact that the default propagation type for new
    mount points is in many cases <b>MS_PRIVATE</b>, <b>MS_SHARED</b> is
    typically more useful. For this reason, <b>systemd</b>(1) automatically
    remounts all mount points as <b>MS_SHARED</b> on system startup. Thus, on
    most modern systems, the default propagation type is in practice
    <b>MS_SHARED</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Since, when one uses <b>unshare</b>(1) to create a mount
    namespace, the goal is commonly to provide full isolation of the mount
    points in the new namespace, <b>unshare</b>(1) (since <i>util-linux</i>
    version 2.27) in turn reverses the step performed by <b>systemd</b>(1), by
    making all mount points private in the new namespace. That is,
    <b>unshare</b>(1) performs the equivalent of the following in the new mount
    namespace:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
mount --make-rprivate /

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">To prevent this, one can use the
    <i>--propagation&#x00A0;unchanged</i> option to <b>unshare</b>(1).</p>
<p class="Pp">An application that creates a new mount namespace directly using
    <b>clone</b>(2) or <b>unshare</b>(2) may desire to prevent propagation of
    mount events to other mount namespaces (as is done by <b>unshare</b>(1)).
    This can be done by changing the propagation type of mount points in the new
    namespace to either <b>MS_SLAVE</b> or <b>MS_PRIVATE</b>. using a call such
    as the following:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
    <br/>
    <pre>
mount(NULL, &quot;/&quot;, MS_SLAVE | MS_REC, NULL);
