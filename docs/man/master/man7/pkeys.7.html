pkeys - overview of Memory Protection Keys
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Memory Protection Keys (pkeys) are an extension to existing page-based memory
  permissions. Normal page permissions using page tables require expensive
  system calls and TLB invalidations when changing permissions. Memory
  Protection Keys provide a mechanism for changing protections without requiring
  modification of the page tables on every permission change.
<p class="Pp">To use pkeys, software must first &quot;tag&quot; a page in the
    page tables with a pkey. After this tag is in place, an application only has
    to change the contents of a register in order to remove write access, or all
    access to a tagged page.</p>
<p class="Pp">Protection keys work in conjunction with the existing
    <b>PROT_READ</b>/ <b>PROT_WRITE</b>/ <b>PROT_EXEC</b> permissions passed to
    system calls such as <b>mprotect</b>(2) and <b>mmap</b>(2), but always act
    to further restrict these traditional permission mechanisms.</p>
<p class="Pp">If a process performs an access that violates pkey restrictions,
    it receives a <b>SIGSEGV</b> signal. See <b>sigaction</b>(2) for details of
    the information available with that signal.</p>
<p class="Pp">To use the pkeys feature, the processor must support it, and the
    kernel must contain support for the feature on a given processor. As of
    early 2016 only future Intel x86 processors are supported, and this hardware
    supports 16 protection keys in each process. However, pkey 0 is used as the
    default key, so a maximum of 15 are available for actual application use.
    The default key is assigned to any memory region for which a pkey has not
    been explicitly assigned via <b>pkey_mprotect</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp">Protection keys have the potential to add a layer of security and
    reliability to applications. But they have not been primarily designed as a
    security feature. For instance, WRPKRU is a completely unprivileged
    instruction, so pkeys are useless in any case that an attacker controls the
    PKRU register or can execute arbitrary instructions.</p>
<p class="Pp">Applications should be very careful to ensure that they do not
    &quot;leak&quot; protection keys. For instance, before calling
    <b>pkey_free</b>(2), the application should be sure that no memory has that
    pkey assigned. If the application left the freed pkey assigned, a future
    user of that pkey might inadvertently change the permissions of an unrelated
    data structure, which could impact security or stability. The kernel
    currently allows in-use pkeys to have <b>pkey_free</b>(2) called on them
    because it would have processor or memory performance implications to
    perform the additional checks needed to disallow it. Implementation of the
    necessary checks is left up to applications. Applications may implement
    these checks by searching the <i>/proc/[pid]/smaps</i> file for memory
    regions with the pkey assigned. Further details can be found in
    <b>proc</b>(5).</p>
<p class="Pp">Any application wanting to use protection keys needs to be able to
    function without them. They might be unavailable because the hardware that
    the application runs on does not support them, the kernel code does not
    contain support, the kernel support has been disabled, or because the keys
    have all been allocated, perhaps by a library the application is using. It
    is recommended that applications wanting to use protection keys should
    simply call <b>pkey_alloc</b>(2) and test whether the call succeeds, instead
    of attempting to detect support for the feature in any other way.</p>
<p class="Pp">Although unnecessary, hardware support for protection keys may be
    enumerated with the <i>cpuid</i> instruction. Details of how to do this can
    be found in the Intel Software Developers Manual. The kernel performs this
    enumeration and exposes the information in <i>/proc/cpuinfo</i> under the
    &quot;flags&quot; field. The string &quot;pku&quot; in this field indicates
    hardware support for protection keys and the string &quot;ospke&quot;
    indicates that the kernel contains and has enabled protection keys
  support.</p>
<p class="Pp">Applications using threads and protection keys should be
    especially careful. Threads inherit the protection key rights of the parent
    at the time of the <b>clone</b>(2), system call. Applications should either
    ensure that their own permissions are appropriate for child threads at the
    time when <b>clone</b>(2) is called, or ensure that each child thread can
    perform its own initialization of protection key rights.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Signal_Handler_Behavior"><a class="permalink" href="#Signal_Handler_Behavior">Signal
  Handler Behavior</a></h2>
Each time a signal handler is invoked (including nested signals), the thread is
  temporarily given a new, default set of protection key rights that override
  the rights from the interrupted context. This means that applications must
  re-establish their desired protection key rights upon entering a signal
  handler if the desired rights differ from the defaults. The rights of any
  interrupted context are restored when the signal handler returns.
<p class="Pp">This signal behavior is unusual and is due to the fact that the
    x86 PKRU register (which stores protection key access rights) is managed
    with the same hardware mechanism (XSAVE) that manages floating-point
    registers. The signal behavior is the same as that of floating-point
    registers.</p>

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Protection_Keys_system_calls"><a class="permalink" href="#Protection_Keys_system_calls">Protection
  Keys system calls</a></h2>
The Linux kernel implements the following pkey-related system calls:
  <b>pkey_mprotect</b>(2), <b>pkey_alloc</b>(2), and <b>pkey_free</b>(2).
<p class="Pp">The Linux pkey system calls are available only if the kernel was
    configured and built with the <b>CONFIG_X86_INTEL_MEMORY_PROTECTION_KEYS</b>
    option.</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLE"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLE">EXAMPLE</a></h1>
The program below allocates a page of memory with read and write permissions. It
  then writes some data to the memory and successfully reads it back. After
  that, it attempts to allocate a protection key and disallows access to the
  page by using the WRPKRU instruction. It then tries to access the page, which
  we now expect to cause a fatal signal to the application.
