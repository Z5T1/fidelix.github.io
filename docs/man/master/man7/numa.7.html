numa - overview of Non-Uniform Memory Architecture
</section>
<section class="Sh">
<h1 class="Sh" id="DESCRIPTION"><a class="permalink" href="#DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></h1>
Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) refers to multiprocessor systems whose memory
  is divided into multiple memory nodes. The access time of a memory node
  depends on the relative locations of the accessing CPU and the accessed node.
  (This contrasts with a symmetric multiprocessor system, where the access time
  for all of the memory is the same for all CPUs.) Normally, each CPU on a NUMA
  system has a local memory node whose contents can be accessed faster than the
  memory in the node local to another CPU or the memory on a bus shared by all
  CPUs.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="NUMA_system_calls"><a class="permalink" href="#NUMA_system_calls">NUMA
  system calls</a></h2>
The Linux kernel implements the following NUMA-related system calls:
  <b>get_mempolicy</b>(2), <b>mbind</b>(2), <b>migrate_pages</b>(2),
  <b>move_pages</b>(2), and <b>set_mempolicy</b>(2). However, applications
  should normally use the interface provided by <i>libnuma</i>; see
  &quot;Library Support&quot; below.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="/proc/_number_/numa_maps_(since_Linux_2.6.14)"><a class="permalink" href="#/proc/_number_/numa_maps_(since_Linux_2.6.14)">/proc/[number]/numa_maps
  (since Linux 2.6.14)</a></h2>
This file displays information about a process's NUMA memory policy and
  allocation.
<p class="Pp">Each line contains information about a memory range used by the
    process, displaying&#x2014;among other information&#x2014;the effective
    memory policy for that memory range and on which nodes the pages have been
    allocated.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>numa_maps</i> is a read-only file. When
    <i>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/numa_maps</i> is read, the kernel will scan the virtual
    address space of the process and report how memory is used. One line is
    displayed for each unique memory range of the process.</p>
<p class="Pp">The first field of each line shows the starting address of the
    memory range. This field allows a correlation with the contents of the
    <i>/proc/&lt;pid&gt;/maps</i> file, which contains the end address of the
    range and other information, such as the access permissions and sharing.</p>
<p class="Pp">The second field shows the memory policy currently in effect for
    the memory range. Note that the effective policy is not necessarily the
    policy installed by the process for that memory range. Specifically, if the
    process installed a &quot;default&quot; policy for that range, the effective
    policy for that range will be the process policy, which may or may not be
    &quot;default&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The rest of the line contains information about the pages
    allocated in the memory range, as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>N&lt;node&gt;=&lt;nr_pages&gt;</i></dt>
  <dd>The number of pages allocated on <i>&lt;node&gt;</i>.
      <i>&lt;nr_pages&gt;</i> includes only pages currently mapped by the
      process. Page migration and memory reclaim may have temporarily unmapped
      pages associated with this memory range. These pages may show up again
      only after the process has attempted to reference them. If the memory
      range represents a shared memory area or file mapping, other processes may
      currently have additional pages mapped in a corresponding memory
    range.</dd>
  <dt><i>file=&lt;filename&gt;</i></dt>
  <dd>The file backing the memory range. If the file is mapped as private, write
      accesses may have generated COW (Copy-On-Write) pages in this memory
      range. These pages are displayed as anonymous pages.</dd>
  <dt><i>heap</i></dt>
  <dd>Memory range is used for the heap.</dd>
  <dt><i>stack</i></dt>
  <dd>Memory range is used for the stack.</dd>
  <dt><i>huge</i></dt>
  <dd>Huge memory range. The page counts shown are huge pages and not regular
      sized pages.</dd>
  <dt><i>anon=&lt;pages&gt;</i></dt>
  <dd>The number of anonymous page in the range.</dd>
  <dt><i>dirty=&lt;pages&gt;</i></dt>
  <dd>Number of dirty pages.</dd>
  <dt><i>mapped=&lt;pages&gt;</i></dt>
  <dd>Total number of mapped pages, if different from <i>dirty</i> and
      <i>anon</i> pages.</dd>
  <dt><i>mapmax=&lt;count&gt;</i></dt>
  <dd>Maximum mapcount (number of processes mapping a single page) encountered
      during the scan. This may be used as an indicator of the degree of sharing
      occurring in a given memory range.</dd>
  <dt><i>swapcache=&lt;count&gt;</i></dt>
  <dd>Number of pages that have an associated entry on a swap device.</dd>
  <dt><i>active=&lt;pages&gt;</i></dt>
  <dd>The number of pages on the active list. This field is shown only if
      different from the number of pages in this range. This means that some
      inactive pages exist in the memory range that may be removed from memory
      by the swapper soon.</dd>
  <dt><i>writeback=&lt;pages&gt;</i></dt>
  <dd>Number of pages that are currently being written out to disk.</dd>

The Linux NUMA system calls and <i>/proc</i> interface are available only if the
  kernel was configured and built with the <b>CONFIG_NUMA</b> option.

Link with <i>-lnuma</i> to get the system call definitions. <i>libnuma</i> and
  the required <i>&lt;numaif.h&gt;</i> header are available in the
  <i>numactl</i> package.
<p class="Pp">However, applications should not use these system calls directly.
    Instead, the higher level interface provided by the <b>numa</b>(3) functions
    in the <i>numactl</i> package is recommended. The <i>numactl</i> package is
    available at
    <a class="Lk" href="ftp://oss.sgi.com/www/projects/libnuma/download/">ftp://oss.sgi.com/www/projects/libnuma/download/</a>.
    The package is also included in some Linux distributions. Some distributions
    include the development library and header in the separate
    <i>numactl-devel</i> package.</p>
