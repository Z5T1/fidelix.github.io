For the purpose of performing permission checks, traditional UNIX
  implementations distinguish two categories of processes: <i>privileged</i>
  processes (whose effective user ID is 0, referred to as superuser or root),
  and <i>unprivileged</i> processes (whose effective UID is nonzero). Privileged
  processes bypass all kernel permission checks, while unprivileged processes
  are subject to full permission checking based on the process's credentials
  (usually: effective UID, effective GID, and supplementary group list).
<p class="Pp">Starting with kernel 2.2, Linux divides the privileges
    traditionally associated with superuser into distinct units, known as
    <i>capabilities</i>, which can be independently enabled and disabled.
    Capabilities are a per-thread attribute.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Notes_to_kernel_developers"><a class="permalink" href="#Notes_to_kernel_developers">Notes
  to kernel developers</a></h2>
When adding a new kernel feature that should be governed by a capability,
  consider the following points.
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The goal of capabilities is divide the power of superuser into pieces,
      such that if a program that has one or more capabilities is compromised,
      its power to do damage to the system would be less than the same program
      running with root privilege.</li>
  <li>You have the choice of either creating a new capability for your new
      feature, or associating the feature with one of the existing capabilities.
      In order to keep the set of capabilities to a manageable size, the latter
      option is preferable, unless there are compelling reasons to take the
      former option. (There is also a technical limit: the size of capability
      sets is currently limited to 64 bits.)</li>
  <li>To determine which existing capability might best be associated with your
      new feature, review the list of capabilities above in order to find a
      &quot;silo&quot; into which your new feature best fits. One approach to
      take is to determine if there are other features requiring capabilities
      that will always be used along with the new feature. If the new feature is
      useless without these other features, you should use the same capability
      as the other features.</li>
  <li><i>Don't</i> choose <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> if you can possibly avoid it! A
      vast proportion of existing capability checks are associated with this
      capability (see the partial list above). It can plausibly be called
      &quot;the new root&quot;, since on the one hand, it confers a wide range
      of powers, and on the other hand, its broad scope means that this is the
      capability that is required by many privileged programs. Don't make the
      problem worse. The only new features that should be associated with
      <b>CAP_SYS_ADMIN</b> are ones that <i>closely</i> match existing uses in
      that silo.</li>
  <li>If you have determined that it really is necessary to create a new
      capability for your feature, don't make or name it as a
      &quot;single-use&quot; capability. Thus, for example, the addition of the
      highly specific <b>CAP_SYS_PACCT</b> was probably a mistake. Instead, try
      to identify and name your new capability as a broader silo into which
      other related future use cases might fit.</li>

Since kernel 2.6.24, the kernel supports associating capability sets with an
  executable file using <b>setcap</b>(8). The file capability sets are stored in
  an extended attribute (see <b>setxattr</b>(2) and <b>xattr</b>(7)) named
  <i>security.capability</i>. Writing to this extended attribute requires the
  <b>CAP_SETFCAP</b> capability. The file capability sets, in conjunction with
  the capability sets of the thread, determine the capabilities of a thread
  after an <b>execve</b>(2).
<p class="Pp">The three file capability sets are:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>Permitted</i> (formerly known as <i>forced</i>):</dt>
  <dd>These capabilities are automatically permitted to the thread, regardless
      of the thread's inheritable capabilities.</dd>
  <dt><i>Inheritable</i> (formerly known as <i>allowed</i>):</dt>
  <dd>This set is ANDed with the thread's inheritable set to determine which

  <dd>This is not a set, but rather just a single bit. If this bit is set, then

<h2 class="Ss" id="File_capability_extended_attribute_versioning"><a class="permalink" href="#File_capability_extended_attribute_versioning">File
  capability extended attribute versioning</a></h2>
To allow extensibility, the kernel supports a scheme to encode a version number
  inside the <i>security.capability</i> extended attribute that is used to
  implement file capabilities. These version numbers are internal to the
  implementation, and not directly visible to user-space applications. To date,
  the following versions are supported:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>VFS_CAP_REVISION_1</b></dt>
  <dd>This was the original file capability implementation, which supported
      32-bit masks for file capabilities.</dd>
  <dt><b>VFS_CAP_REVISION_2</b> (since Linux 2.6.25)</dt>
  <dd>This version allows for file capability masks that are 64 bits in size,
      and was necessary as the number of supported capabilities grew beyond 32.
      The kernel transparently continues to support the execution of files that
      have 32-bit version 1 capability masks, but when adding capabilities to
      files that did not previously have capabilities, or modifying the
      capabilities of existing files, it automatically uses the version 2 scheme
      (or possibly the version 3 scheme, as described below).</dd>
  <dt><b>VFS_CAP_REVISION_3</b> (since Linux 4.14)</dt>
  <dd>Version 3 file capabilities are provided to support namespaced file
      capabilities (described below).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>As with version 2 file capabilities, version 3 capability masks are 64
      bits in size. But in addition, the root user ID of namespace is encoded in
      the <i>security.capability</i> extended attribute. (A namespace's root
      user ID is the value that user ID 0 inside that namespace maps to in the
      initial user namespace.)</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Version 3 file capabilities are designed to coexist with version 2
      capabilities; that is, on a modern Linux system, there may be some files
      with version 2 capabilities while others have version 3 capabilities.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Before Linux 4.14, the only kind of file capability extended
    attribute that could be attached to a file was a <b>VFS_CAP_REVISION_2</b>
    attribute. Since Linux 4.14, the version of the <i>security.capability</i>
    extended attribute that is attached to a file depends on the circumstances
    in which the attribute was created.</p>
<p class="Pp">Starting with Linux 4.14, a <i>security.capability</i> extended
    attribute is automatically created as (or converted to) a version 3
    (<b>VFS_CAP_REVISION_3</b>) attribute if both of the following are true:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>(1)</dt>
  <dd>The thread writing the attribute resides in a noninitial user namespace.
      (More precisely: the thread resides in a user namespace other than the one
      from which the underlying filesystem was mounted.)</dd>
  <dt>(2)</dt>
  <dd>The thread has the <b>CAP_SETFCAP</b> capability over the file inode,
      meaning that (a) the thread has the <b>CAP_SETFCAP</b> capability in its
      own user namespace; and (b) the UID and GID of the file inode have
      mappings in the writer's user namespace.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">When a <b>VFS_CAP_REVISION_3</b> <i>security.capability</i>
    extended attribute is created, the root user ID of the creating thread's
    user namespace is saved in the extended attribute.</p>
<p class="Pp">By contrast, creating or modifying a <i>security.capability</i>
    extended attribute from a privileged (<b>CAP_SETFCAP</b>) thread that
    resides in the namespace where the underlying filesystem was mounted (this
    normally means the initial user namespace) automatically results in the
    creation of a version 2 (<b>VFS_CAP_REVISION_2</b>) attribute.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that the creation of a version 3 <i>security.capability</i>
    extended attribute is automatic. That is to say, when a user-space
    application writes (<b>setxattr</b>(2)) a <i>security.capability</i>
    attribute in the version 2 format, the kernel will automatically create a
    version 3 attribute if the attribute is created in the circumstances
    described above. Correspondingly, when a version 3
    <i>security.capability</i> attribute is retrieved (<b>getxattr</b>(2)) by a
    process that resides inside a user namespace that was created by the root
    user ID (or a descendant of that user namespace), the returned attribute is
    (automatically) simplified to appear as a version 2 attribute (i.e., the
    returned value is the size of a version 2 attribute and does not include the
    root user ID). These automatic translations mean that no changes are
    required to user-space tools (e.g., <b>setcap</b>(1) and <b>getcap</b>(1))
    in order for those tools to be used to create and retrieve version 3
    <i>security.capability</i> attributes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Note that a file can have either a version 2 or a version 3
    <i>security.capability</i> extended attribute associated with it, but not
    both: creation or modification of the <i>security.capability</i> extended
    attribute will automatically modify the version according to the
    circumstances in which the extended attribute is created or modified.</p>

  <li>The ambient capability set is present only since Linux 4.3. When
      determining the transformation of the ambient set during <b>execve</b>(2),
      a privileged file is one that has capabilities or has the set-user-ID or
      set-group-ID bit set.</li>
  <li>Prior to Linux 2.6.25, the bounding set was a system-wide attribute shared
      by all threads. That system-wide value was employed to calculate the new

      for <i>P(bounding)</i>.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp"><i>Note</i>: during the capability transitions described above,

    booted with the <i>no_file_caps</i> option.</p>
<p class="Pp"><i>Note</i>: according to the rules above, if a process with
    nonzero user IDs performs an <b>execve</b>(2) then any capabilities that are
    present in its permitted and effective sets will be cleared. For the

<h2 class="Ss" id="Safety_checking_for_capability-dumb_binaries"><a class="permalink" href="#Safety_checking_for_capability-dumb_binaries">Safety
  checking for capability-dumb binaries</a></h2>
A capability-dumb binary is an application that has been marked to have file
  capabilities, but has not been converted to use the <b>libcap</b>(3) API to
  manipulate its capabilities. (In other words, this is a traditional
  set-user-ID-root program that has been switched to use file capabilities, but
  whose code has not been modified to understand capabilities.) For such
  applications, the effective capability bit is set on the file, so that the
  file permitted capabilities are automatically enabled in the process effective
  set when executing the file. The kernel recognizes a file which has the
  effective capability bit set as capability-dumb for the purpose of the check
  described here.
<p class="Pp">When executing a capability-dumb binary, the kernel checks if the
    process obtained all permitted capabilities that were specified in the file
    permitted set, after the capability transformations described above have
    been performed. (The typical reason why this might <i>not</i> occur is that
    the capability bounding set masked out some of the capabilities in the file
    permitted set.) If the process did not obtain the full set of file permitted
    capabilities, then <b>execve</b>(2) fails with the error <b>EPERM</b>. This
    prevents possible security risks that could arise when a capability-dumb
    application is executed with less privilege that it needs. Note that, by
    definition, the application could not itself recognize this problem, since
    it does not employ the <b>libcap</b>(3) API.</p>

In order to mirror traditional UNIX semantics, the kernel performs special
  treatment of file capabilities when a process with UID 0 (root) executes a
  program and when a set-user-ID-root program is executed.
<p class="Pp">After having performed any changes to the process effective ID
    that were triggered by the set-user-ID mode bit of the binary&#x2014;e.g.,
    switching the effective user ID to 0 (root) because a set-user-ID-root
    program was executed&#x2014;the kernel calculates the file capability sets
    as follows:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>1.</dt>
  <dd>If the real or effective user ID of the process is 0 (root), then the file
      inheritable and permitted sets are ignored; instead they are notionally
      considered to be all ones (i.e., all capabilities enabled). (There is one
      exception to this behavior, described below in <i>Set-user-ID-root
      programs that have file capabilities</i>.)</dd>
  <dt>2.</dt>
  <dd>If the effective user ID of the process is 0 (root) or the file effective
      bit is in fact enabled, then the file effective bit is notionally defined
      to be one (enabled).</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">These notional values for the file's capability sets are then used
    as described above to calculate the transformation of the process's
    capabilities during <b>execve</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp">Thus, when a process with nonzero UIDs <b>execve</b>(2)s a
    set-user-ID-root program that does not have capabilities attached, or when a
    process whose real and effective UIDs are zero <b>execve</b>(2)s a program,
    the calculation of the process's new permitted capabilities simplifies
  to:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
P'(permitted)   = P(inheritable) | P(bounding)
P'(effective)   = P'(permitted)

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">Consequently, the process gains all capabilities in its permitted
    and effective capability sets, except those masked out by the capability
    bounding set. (In the calculation of P'(permitted), the P'(ambient) term can
    be simplified away because it is by definition a proper subset of
    P(inheritable).)</p>

There is one exception to the behavior described under <i>Capabilities and
  execution of programs by root</i>. If (a) the binary that is being executed
  has capabilities attached and (b) the real user ID of the process is
  <i>not</i> 0 (root) and (c) the effective user ID of the process <i>is</i> 0
  (root), then the file capability bits are honored (i.e., they are not
  notionally considered to be all ones). The usual way in which this situation
  can arise is when executing a set-UID-root program that also has file
  capabilities. When such a program is executed, the process gains just the
  capabilities granted by the program (i.e., not all capabilities, as would
  occur when executing a set-user-ID-root program that does not have any
  associated file capabilities).
<p class="Pp">Note that one can assign empty capability sets to a program file,
    and thus it is possible to create a set-user-ID-root program that changes
    the effective and saved set-user-ID of the process that executes the program

<h2 class="Ss" id="Capability_bounding_set"><a class="permalink" href="#Capability_bounding_set">Capability
  bounding set</a></h2>
The capability bounding set is a security mechanism that can be used to limit
  the capabilities that can be gained during an <b>execve</b>(2). The bounding
  set is used in the following ways:
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>During an <b>execve</b>(2), the capability bounding set is ANDed with the
      file permitted capability set, and the result of this operation is
      assigned to the thread's permitted capability set. The capability bounding
      set thus places a limit on the permitted capabilities that may be granted
      by an executable file.</li>
  <li>(Since Linux 2.6.25) The capability bounding set acts as a limiting
      superset for the capabilities that a thread can add to its inheritable set
      using <b>capset</b>(2). This means that if a capability is not in the
      bounding set, then a thread can't add this capability to its inheritable
      set, even if it was in its permitted capabilities, and thereby cannot have
      this capability preserved in its permitted set when it <b>execve</b>(2)s a
      file that has the capability in its inheritable set.</li>
</ul>
<p class="Pp">Note that the bounding set masks the file permitted capabilities,
    but not the inheritable capabilities. If a thread maintains a capability in
    its inheritable set that is not in its bounding set, then it can still gain
    that capability in its permitted set by executing a file that has the
    capability in its inheritable set.</p>
<p class="Pp">Depending on the kernel version, the capability bounding set is
    either a system-wide attribute, or a per-process attribute.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Capability bounding set from Linux 2.6.25 onward</b></p>
<p class="Pp">From Linux 2.6.25, the <i>capability bounding set</i> is a
    per-thread attribute. (The system-wide capability bounding set described
    below no longer exists.)</p>
<p class="Pp">The bounding set is inherited at <b>fork</b>(2) from the thread's
    parent, and is preserved across an <b>execve</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp">A thread may remove capabilities from its capability bounding set
    using the <b>prctl</b>(2) <b>PR_CAPBSET_DROP</b> operation, provided it has
    the <b>CAP_SETPCAP</b> capability. Once a capability has been dropped from
    the bounding set, it cannot be restored to that set. A thread can determine
    if a capability is in its bounding set using the <b>prctl</b>(2)
    <b>PR_CAPBSET_READ</b> operation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Removing capabilities from the bounding set is supported only if
    file capabilities are compiled into the kernel. In kernels before Linux
    2.6.33, file capabilities were an optional feature configurable via the
    <b>CONFIG_SECURITY_FILE_CAPABILITIES</b> option. Since Linux 2.6.33, the
    configuration option has been removed and file capabilities are always part
    of the kernel. When file capabilities are compiled into the kernel, the
    <b>init</b> process (the ancestor of all processes) begins with a full
    bounding set. If file capabilities are not compiled into the kernel, then
    <b>init</b> begins with a full bounding set minus <b>CAP_SETPCAP</b>,
    because this capability has a different meaning when there are no file
    capabilities.</p>
<p class="Pp">Removing a capability from the bounding set does not remove it
    from the thread's inheritable set. However it does prevent the capability
    from being added back into the thread's inheritable set in the future.</p>
<p class="Pp"><b>Capability bounding set prior to Linux 2.6.25</b></p>
<p class="Pp">In kernels before 2.6.25, the capability bounding set is a
    system-wide attribute that affects all threads on the system. The bounding
    set is accessible via the file <i>/proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound</i>.
    (Confusingly, this bit mask parameter is expressed as a signed decimal
    number in <i>/proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound</i>.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Only the <b>init</b> process may set capabilities in the
    capability bounding set; other than that, the superuser (more precisely: a
    process with the <b>CAP_SYS_MODULE</b> capability) may only clear
    capabilities from this set.</p>
<p class="Pp">On a standard system the capability bounding set always masks out
    the <b>CAP_SETPCAP</b> capability. To remove this restriction (dangerous!),
    modify the definition of <b>CAP_INIT_EFF_SET</b> in
    <i>include/linux/capability.h</i> and rebuild the kernel.</p>

  securebits flags: establishing a capabilities-only environment</a></h2>
Starting with kernel 2.6.26, and with a kernel in which file capabilities are
  enabled, Linux implements a set of per-thread <i>securebits</i> flags that can
  be used to disable special handling of capabilities for UID 0 (<i>root</i>).
  These flags are as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS</b></dt>
  <dd>Setting this flag allows a thread that has one or more 0 UIDs to retain
      capabilities in its permitted set when it switches all of its UIDs to
      nonzero values. If this flag is not set, then such a UID switch causes the
      thread to lose all permitted capabilities. This flag is always cleared on
      an <b>execve</b>(2).</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Note that even with the <b>SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS</b> flag set, the effective
      capabilities of a thread are cleared when it switches its effective UID to
      a nonzero value. However, if the thread has set this flag and its
      effective UID is already nonzero, and the thread subsequently switches all
      other UIDs to nonzero values, then the effective capabilities will not be
      cleared.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The setting of the <b>SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS</b> flag is ignored if the
      <b>SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP</b> flag is set. (The latter flag provides a
      superset of the effect of the former flag.)</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>This flag provides the same functionality as the older <b>prctl</b>(2)
      <b>PR_SET_KEEPCAPS</b> operation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP</b></dt>
  <dd>Setting this flag stops the kernel from adjusting the process's permitted,
      effective, and ambient capability sets when the thread's effective and
      filesystem UIDs are switched between zero and nonzero values. (See the
      subsection <i>Effect of user ID changes on capabilities</i>.)</dd>
  <dt><b>SECBIT_NOROOT</b></dt>
  <dd>If this bit is set, then the kernel does not grant capabilities when a
      set-user-ID-root program is executed, or when a process with an effective
      or real UID of 0 calls <b>execve</b>(2). (See the subsection
      <i>Capabilities and execution of programs by root</i>.)</dd>
  <dt><b>SECBIT_NO_CAP_AMBIENT_RAISE</b></dt>
  <dd>Setting this flag disallows raising ambient capabilities via the
      <b>prctl</b>(2) <b>PR_CAP_AMBIENT_RAISE</b> operation.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">Each of the above &quot;base&quot; flags has a companion
    &quot;locked&quot; flag. Setting any of the &quot;locked&quot; flags is
    irreversible, and has the effect of preventing further changes to the
    corresponding &quot;base&quot; flag. The locked flags are:
    <b>SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS_LOCKED</b>, <b>SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP_LOCKED</b>,
    <b>SECBIT_NOROOT_LOCKED</b>, and
  <b>SECBIT_NO_CAP_AMBIENT_RAISE_LOCKED</b>.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>securebits</i> flags can be modified and retrieved using
    the <b>prctl</b>(2) <b>PR_SET_SECUREBITS</b> and <b>PR_GET_SECUREBITS</b>
    operations. The <b>CAP_SETPCAP</b> capability is required to modify the
    flags. Note that the <b>SECBIT_*</b> constants are available only after
    including the <i>&lt;linux/securebits.h&gt;</i> header file.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>securebits</i> flags are inherited by child processes.
    During an <b>execve</b>(2), all of the flags are preserved, except
    <b>SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS</b> which is always cleared.</p>
<p class="Pp">An application can use the following call to lock itself, and all
    of its descendants, into an environment where the only way of gaining
    capabilities is by executing a program with associated file
  capabilities:</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
prctl(PR_SET_SECUREBITS,
        /* SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS off */
        SECBIT_KEEP_CAPS_LOCKED |
        SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP |
        SECBIT_NO_SETUID_FIXUP_LOCKED |
        SECBIT_NOROOT |
        SECBIT_NOROOT_LOCKED);
        /* Setting/locking SECBIT_NO_CAP_AMBIENT_RAISE
           is not required */

  &quot;set-user-ID-root&quot; programs</a></h2>
A set-user-ID program whose UID matches the UID that created a user namespace
  will confer capabilities in the process's permitted and effective sets when
  executed by any process inside that namespace or any descendant user
  namespace.
<p class="Pp">The rules about the transformation of the process's capabilities
    during the <b>execve</b>(2) are exactly as described in the subsections
    <i>Transformation of capabilities during execve()</i> and <i>Capabilities
    and execution of programs by root</i>, with the difference that, in the
    latter subsection, &quot;root&quot; is the UID of the creator of the user
    namespace.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Namespaced_file_capabilities"><a class="permalink" href="#Namespaced_file_capabilities">Namespaced
  file capabilities</a></h2>
Traditional (i.e., version 2) file capabilities associate only a set of
  capability masks with a binary executable file. When a process executes a
  binary with such capabilities, it gains the associated capabilities (within
  its user namespace) as per the rules described above in &quot;Transformation
  of capabilities during execve()&quot;.
<p class="Pp">Because version 2 file capabilities confer capabilities to the
    executing process regardless of which user namespace it resides in, only
    privileged processes are permitted to associate capabilities with a file.
    Here, &quot;privileged&quot; means a process that has the <b>CAP_SETFCAP</b>
    capability in the user namespace where the filesystem was mounted (normally
    the initial user namespace). This limitation renders file capabilities
    useless for certain use cases. For example, in user-namespaced containers,
    it can be desirable to be able to create a binary that confers capabilities
    only to processes executed inside that container, but not to processes that
    are executed outside the container.</p>
<p class="Pp">Linux 4.14 added so-called namespaced file capabilities to support
    such use cases. Namespaced file capabilities are recorded as version 3
    (i.e., <b>VFS_CAP_REVISION_3</b>) <i>security.capability</i> extended
    attributes. Such an attribute is automatically created in the circumstances
    described above under &quot;File capability extended attribute
    versioning&quot;. When a version 3 <i>security.capability</i> extended
    attribute is created, the kernel records not just the capability masks in
    the extended attribute, but also the namespace root user ID.</p>
<p class="Pp">As with a binary that has <b>VFS_CAP_REVISION_2</b> file
    capabilities, a binary with <b>VFS_CAP_REVISION_3</b> file capabilities
    confers capabilities to a process during <b>execve</b>(). However,
    capabilities are conferred only if the binary is executed by a process that
    resides in a user namespace whose UID 0 maps to the root user ID that is
    saved in the extended attribute, or when executed by a process that resides
    in a descendant of such a namespace.</p>

When attempting to <b>strace</b>(1) binaries that have capabilities (or
  set-user-ID-root binaries), you may find the <i>-u &lt;username&gt;</i> option
  useful. Something like:
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>sudo strace -o trace.log -u ceci ./myprivprog</b>

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">From kernel 2.5.27 to kernel 2.6.26, capabilities were an optional
    kernel component, and could be enabled/disabled via the
    <b>CONFIG_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES</b> kernel configuration option.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>/proc/[pid]/task/TID/status</i> file can be used to view
    the capability sets of a thread. The <i>/proc/[pid]/status</i> file shows
    the capability sets of a process's main thread. Before Linux 3.8,
    nonexistent capabilities were shown as being enabled (1) in these sets.
    Since Linux 3.8, all nonexistent capabilities (above <b>CAP_LAST_CAP</b>)
    are shown as disabled (0).</p>
<p class="Pp">The <i>libcap</i> package provides a suite of routines for setting
    and getting capabilities that is more comfortable and less likely to change
    than the interface provided by <b>capset</b>(2) and <b>capget</b>(2). This
    package also provides the <b>setcap</b>(8) and <b>getcap</b>(8) programs. It
    can be found at
  <br/>
  <a class="Lk" href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libcap/libcap.git/refs/">https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/libcap/libcap.git/refs/</a>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Before kernel 2.6.24, and from kernel 2.6.24 to kernel 2.6.32 if
    file capabilities are not enabled, a thread with the <b>CAP_SETPCAP</b>
    capability can manipulate the capabilities of threads other than itself.
    However, this is only theoretically possible, since no thread ever has
    <b>CAP_SETPCAP</b> in either of these cases:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>In the pre-2.6.25 implementation the system-wide capability bounding set,
      <i>/proc/sys/kernel/cap-bound</i>, always masks out the <b>CAP_SETPCAP</b>
      capability, and this can not be changed without modifying the kernel
      source and rebuilding the kernel.</li>
  <li>If file capabilities are disabled (i.e., the kernel
      <b>CONFIG_SECURITY_FILE_CAPABILITIES</b> option is disabled), then
      <b>init</b> starts out with the <b>CAP_SETPCAP</b> capability removed from
      its per-process bounding set, and that bounding set is inherited by all
      other processes created on the system.</li>
