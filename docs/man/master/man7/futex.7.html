The Linux kernel provides futexes (&quot;Fast user-space mutexes&quot;) as a
  building block for fast user-space locking and semaphores. Futexes are very
  basic and lend themselves well for building higher-level locking abstractions
  such as mutexes, condition variables, read-write locks, barriers, and
  semaphores.
<p class="Pp">Most programmers will in fact not be using futexes directly but
    will instead rely on system libraries built on them, such as the Native
    POSIX Thread Library (NPTL) (see <b>pthreads</b>(7)).</p>
<p class="Pp">A futex is identified by a piece of memory which can be shared
    between processes or threads. In these different processes, the futex need
    not have identical addresses. In its bare form, a futex has semaphore
    semantics; it is a counter that can be incremented and decremented
    atomically; processes can wait for the value to become positive.</p>
<p class="Pp">Futex operation occurs entirely in user space for the noncontended
    case. The kernel is involved only to arbitrate the contended case. As any
    sane design will strive for noncontention, futexes are also optimized for
    this situation.</p>
<p class="Pp">In its bare form, a futex is an aligned integer which is touched
    only by atomic assembler instructions. This integer is four bytes long on
    all platforms. Processes can share this integer using <b>mmap</b>(2), via
    shared memory segments, or because they share memory space, in which case
    the application is commonly called multithreaded.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Semantics"><a class="permalink" href="#Semantics">Semantics</a></h2>
Any futex operation starts in user space, but it may be necessary to communicate
  with the kernel using the <b>futex</b>(2) system call.
<p class="Pp">To &quot;up&quot; a futex, execute the proper assembler
    instructions that will cause the host CPU to atomically increment the
    integer. Afterward, check if it has in fact changed from 0 to 1, in which
    case there were no waiters and the operation is done. This is the
    noncontended case which is fast and should be common.</p>
<p class="Pp">In the contended case, the atomic increment changed the counter
    from -1 (or some other negative number). If this is detected, there are
    waiters. User space should now set the counter to 1 and instruct the kernel
    to wake up any waiters using the <b>FUTEX_WAKE</b> operation.</p>
<p class="Pp">Waiting on a futex, to &quot;down&quot; it, is the reverse
    operation. Atomically decrement the counter and check if it changed to 0, in
    which case the operation is done and the futex was uncontended. In all other
    circumstances, the process should set the counter to -1 and request that the
    kernel wait for another process to up the futex. This is done using the
    <b>FUTEX_WAIT</b> operation.</p>
<p class="Pp">The <b>futex</b>(2) system call can optionally be passed a timeout
    specifying how long the kernel should wait for the futex to be upped. In
    this case, semantics are more complex and the programmer is referred to
    <b>futex</b>(2) for more details. The same holds for asynchronous futex
    waiting.</p>

Initial futex support was merged in Linux 2.5.7 but with different semantics
  from those described above. Current semantics are available from Linux 2.5.40
  onward.

To reiterate, bare futexes are not intended as an easy-to-use abstraction for
  end users. Implementors are expected to be assembly literate and to have read
  the sources of the futex user-space library referenced below.
<p class="Pp">This man page illustrates the most common use of the
    <b>futex</b>(2) primitives; it is by no means the only one.</p>
