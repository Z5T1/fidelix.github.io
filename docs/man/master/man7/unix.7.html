The <b>AF_UNIX</b> (also known as <b>AF_LOCAL</b>) socket family is used to
  communicate between processes on the same machine efficiently. Traditionally,
  UNIX domain sockets can be either unnamed, or bound to a filesystem pathname
  (marked as being of type socket). Linux also supports an abstract namespace
  which is independent of the filesystem.
<p class="Pp">Valid socket types in the UNIX domain are: <b>SOCK_STREAM</b>, for
    a stream-oriented socket; <b>SOCK_DGRAM</b>, for a datagram-oriented socket
    that preserves message boundaries (as on most UNIX implementations, UNIX
    domain datagram sockets are always reliable and don't reorder datagrams);
    and (since Linux 2.6.4) <b>SOCK_SEQPACKET</b>, for a sequenced-packet socket
    that is connection-oriented, preserves message boundaries, and delivers
    messages in the order that they were sent.</p>
<p class="Pp">UNIX domain sockets support passing file descriptors or process
    credentials to other processes using ancillary data.</p>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Address_format"><a class="permalink" href="#Address_format">Address
  format</a></h2>
A UNIX domain socket address is represented in the following structure:
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
struct sockaddr_un {
    sa_family_t sun_family;               /* AF_UNIX */
    char        sun_path[108];            /* Pathname */
};

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">The <i>sun_family</i> field always contains <b>AF_UNIX</b>. On
    Linux, <i>sun_path</i> is 108 bytes in size; see also NOTES, below.</p>
<p class="Pp">Various systems calls (for example, <b>bind</b>(2),
    <b>connect</b>(2), and <b>sendto</b>(2)) take a <i>sockaddr_un</i> argument
    as input. Some other system calls (for example, <b>getsockname</b>(2),
    <b>getpeername</b>(2), <b>recvfrom</b>(2), and <b>accept</b>(2)) return an
    argument of this type.</p>
<p class="Pp">Three types of address are distinguished in the <i>sockaddr_un</i>
    structure:</p>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>*</dt>
  <dd><i>pathname</i>: a UNIX domain socket can be bound to a null-terminated
      filesystem pathname using <b>bind</b>(2). When the address of a pathname
      socket is returned (by one of the system calls noted above), its length
    is</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
     offsetof(struct sockaddr_un, sun_path) + strlen(sun_path) + 1</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>and <i>sun_path</i> contains the null-terminated pathname. (On Linux, the
      above <b>offsetof</b>() expression equates to the same value as
      <i>sizeof(sa_family_t)</i>, but some other implementations include other
      fields before <i>sun_path</i>, so the <b>offsetof</b>() expression more
      portably describes the size of the address structure.)</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>For further details of pathname sockets, see below.</dd>
</dl>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li><i>unnamed</i>: A stream socket that has not been bound to a pathname
      using <b>bind</b>(2) has no name. Likewise, the two sockets created by
      <b>socketpair</b>(2) are unnamed. When the address of an unnamed socket is
      returned, its length is <i>sizeof(sa_family_t)</i>, and <i>sun_path</i>
      should not be inspected.</li>
  <li><i>abstract</i>: an abstract socket address is distinguished (from a
      pathname socket) by the fact that <i>sun_path[0]</i> is a null byte
      ('\0'). The socket's address in this namespace is given by the additional
      bytes in <i>sun_path</i> that are covered by the specified length of the
      address structure. (Null bytes in the name have no special significance.)
      The name has no connection with filesystem pathnames. When the address of
      an abstract socket is returned, the returned <i>addrlen</i> is greater
      than <i>sizeof(sa_family_t)</i> (i.e., greater than 2), and the name of
      the socket is contained in the first <i>(addrlen -
      sizeof(sa_family_t))</i> bytes of <i>sun_path</i>.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Pathname_sockets"><a class="permalink" href="#Pathname_sockets">Pathname
  sockets</a></h2>
When binding a socket to a pathname, a few rules should be observed for maximum
  portability and ease of coding:
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>The pathname in <i>sun_path</i> should be null-terminated.</li>
  <li>The length of the pathname, including the terminating null byte, should
      not exceed the size of <i>sun_path</i>.</li>
  <li>The <i>addrlen</i> argument that describes the enclosing
      <i>sockaddr_un</i> structure should have a value of at least:</li>
</ul>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
    <pre>
    offsetof(struct sockaddr_un, sun_path)+strlen(addr.sun_path)+1
    </pre>
  </dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>or, more simply, <i>addrlen</i> can be specified as <i>sizeof(struct
      sockaddr_un)</i>.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">There is some variation in how implementations handle UNIX domain
    socket addresses that do not follow the above rules. For example, some (but
    not all) implementations append a null terminator if none is present in the
    supplied <i>sun_path</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">When coding portable applications, keep in mind that some
    implementations have <i>sun_path</i> as short as 92 bytes.</p>
<p class="Pp">Various system calls (<b>accept</b>(2), <b>recvfrom</b>(2),
    <b>getsockname</b>(2), <b>getpeername</b>(2)) return socket address
    structures. When applied to UNIX domain sockets, the value-result
    <i>addrlen</i> argument supplied to the call should be initialized as above.
    Upon return, the argument is set to indicate the <i>actual</i> size of the
    address structure. The caller should check the value returned in this
    argument: if the output value exceeds the input value, then there is no
    guarantee that a null terminator is present in <i>sun_path</i>. (See
  BUGS.)</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Pathname_socket_ownership_and_permissions"><a class="permalink" href="#Pathname_socket_ownership_and_permissions">Pathname
  socket ownership and permissions</a></h2>
In the Linux implementation, pathname sockets honor the permissions of the
  directory they are in. Creation of a new socket fails if the process does not
  have write and search (execute) permission on the directory in which the
  socket is created.
<p class="Pp">On Linux, connecting to a stream socket object requires write
    permission on that socket; sending a datagram to a datagram socket likewise
    requires write permission on that socket. POSIX does not make any statement
    about the effect of the permissions on a socket file, and on some systems
    (e.g., older BSDs), the socket permissions are ignored. Portable programs
    should not rely on this feature for security.</p>
<p class="Pp">When creating a new socket, the owner and group of the socket file
    are set according to the usual rules. The socket file has all permissions
    enabled, other than those that are turned off by the process
    <b>umask</b>(2).</p>
<p class="Pp">The owner, group, and permissions of a pathname socket can be
    changed (using <b>chown</b>(2) and <b>chmod</b>(2)).</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Abstract_sockets"><a class="permalink" href="#Abstract_sockets">Abstract
  sockets</a></h2>
Socket permissions have no meaning for abstract sockets: the process
  <b>umask</b>(2) has no effect when binding an abstract socket, and changing
  the ownership and permissions of the object (via <b>fchown</b>(2) and
  <b>fchmod</b>(2)) has no effect on the accessibility of the socket.
<p class="Pp">Abstract sockets automatically disappear when all open references
    to the socket are closed.</p>

  extension.</p>

If a <b>bind</b>(2) call specifies <i>addrlen</i> as <i>sizeof(sa_family_t)</i>,
  or the <b>SO_PASSCRED</b> socket option was specified for a socket that was
  not explicitly bound to an address, then the socket is autobound to an
  abstract address. The address consists of a null byte followed by 5 bytes in
  the character set <i>[0-9a-f]</i>. Thus, there is a limit of 2^20 autobind
  addresses. (From Linux 2.1.15, when the autobind feature was added, 8 bytes
  were used, and the limit was thus 2^32 autobind addresses. The change to 5
  bytes came in Linux 2.3.15.)

The following paragraphs describe domain-specific details and unsupported

<p class="Pp">The <b>SO_SNDBUF</b> socket option does have an effect for UNIX
    domain sockets, but the <b>SO_RCVBUF</b> option does not. For datagram

Binding to a socket with a filename creates a socket in the filesystem that must
  be deleted by the caller when it is no longer needed (using <b>unlink</b>(2)).
  The usual UNIX close-behind semantics apply; the socket can be unlinked at any
  time and will be finally removed from the filesystem when the last reference
  to it is closed.
<p class="Pp">To pass file descriptors or credentials over a <b>SOCK_STREAM</b>
    socket, you must to send or receive at least one byte of nonancillary data
    in the same <b>sendmsg</b>(2) or <b>recvmsg</b>(2) call.</p>

When binding a socket to an address, Linux is one of the implementations that
  appends a null terminator if none is supplied in <i>sun_path</i>. In most
  cases this is unproblematic: when the socket address is retrieved, it will be
  one byte longer than that supplied when the socket was bound. However, there
  is one case where confusing behavior can result: if 108 non-null bytes are
  supplied when a socket is bound, then the addition of the null terminator
  takes the length of the pathname beyond <i>sizeof(sun_path)</i>. Consequently,
  when retrieving the socket address (for example, via <b>accept</b>(2)), if the
  input <i>addrlen</i> argument for the retrieving call is specified as
  <i>sizeof(struct sockaddr_un)</i>, then the returned address structure
  <i>won't</i> have a null terminator in <i>sun_path</i>.
<p class="Pp">In addition, some implementations don't require a null terminator
    when binding a socket (the <i>addrlen</i> argument is used to determine the
    length of <i>sun_path</i>) and when the socket address is retrieved on these
    implementations, there is no null terminator in <i>sun_path</i>.</p>
<p class="Pp">Applications that retrieve socket addresses can (portably) code to
    handle the possibility that there is no null terminator in <i>sun_path</i>
    by respecting the fact that the number of valid bytes in the pathname
  is:</p>
<p class="Pp">
   strnlen(addr.sun_path, addrlen - offsetof(sockaddr_un, sun_path))</p>
<p class="Pp">Alternatively, an application can retrieve the socket address by
    allocating a buffer of size <i>sizeof(struct sockaddr_un)+1</i> that is
    zeroed out before the retrieval. The retrieving call can specify
    <i>addrlen</i> as <i>sizeof(struct sockaddr_un)</i>, and the extra zero byte
    ensures that there will be a null terminator for the string returned in
    <i>sun_path</i>:</p>

<h1 class="Sh" id="EXAMPLE"><a class="permalink" href="#EXAMPLE">EXAMPLE</a></h1>
The following code demonstrates the use of sequenced-packet sockets for local
  interprocess communication. It consists of two programs. The server program
  waits for a connection from the client program. The client sends each of its
  command-line arguments in separate messages. The server treats the incoming
  messages as integers and adds them up. The client sends the command string
  &quot;END&quot;. The server sends back a message containing the sum of the
  client's integers. The client prints the sum and exits. The server waits for
  the next client to connect. To stop the server, the client is called with the
  command-line argument &quot;DOWN&quot;.
<p class="Pp">The following output was recorded while running the server in the
    background and repeatedly executing the client. Execution of the server
    program ends when it receives the &quot;DOWN&quot; command.</p>
