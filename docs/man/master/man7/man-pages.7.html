This page describes the conventions that should be employed when writing man
  pages for the Linux <i>man-pages</i> project, which documents the user-space
  API provided by the Linux kernel and the GNU C library. The project thus
  provides most of the pages in Section 2, many of the pages that appear in
  Sections 3, 4, and 7, and a few of the pages that appear in Sections 1, 5, and
  8 of the man pages on a Linux system. The conventions described on this page
  may also be useful for authors writing man pages for other projects.
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Sections_of_the_manual_pages"><a class="permalink" href="#Sections_of_the_manual_pages">Sections
  of the manual pages</a></h2>
The manual Sections are traditionally defined as follows:
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><b>1 User commands (Programs)</b></dt>
  <dd>Those commands that can be executed by the user from within a shell.</dd>
  <dt><b>2 System calls</b></dt>
  <dd>Those functions which wrap operations performed by the kernel.</dd>
  <dt><b>3 Library calls</b></dt>
  <dd>All library functions excluding the system call wrappers (Most of the
      <i>libc</i> functions).</dd>
  <dt><b>4 Special files (devices)</b></dt>
  <dd>Files found in <i>/dev</i> which allow to access to devices through the
      kernel.</dd>
  <dt><b>5 File formats and configuration files</b></dt>
  <dd>Describes various human-readable file formats and configuration
    files.</dd>
  <dt><b>6 Games</b></dt>
  <dd>Games and funny little programs available on the system.</dd>
  <dt><b>7 Overview, conventions, and miscellaneous</b></dt>
  <dd>Overviews or descriptions of various topics, conventions and protocols,
      character set standards, the standard filesystem layout, and miscellaneous
      other things.</dd>
  <dt><b>8 System management commands</b></dt>
  <dd>Commands like <b>mount</b>(8), many of which only root can execute.</dd>
</dl>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Macro_package"><a class="permalink" href="#Macro_package">Macro
  package</a></h2>
New manual pages should be marked up using the <b>groff an.tmac</b> package
  described in <b>man</b>(7). This choice is mainly for consistency: the vast
  majority of existing Linux manual pages are marked up using these macros.

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Conventions_for_source_file_layout"><a class="permalink" href="#Conventions_for_source_file_layout">Conventions

Please limit source code line length to no more than about 75 characters
  wherever possible. This helps avoid line-wrapping in some mail clients when
  patches are submitted inline.

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Title_line"><a class="permalink" href="#Title_line">Title

The first command in a man page should be a <b>TH</b> command:

<div class="Bd-indent"><b>.TH</b> <i>title section date source manual</i></div>
<p class="Pp">where:</p>
<div class="Bd-indent">
<dl class="Bl-tag">

  <dd>The title of the man page, written in all caps (e.g.,
    <i>MAN-PAGES</i>).</dd>

  <dd>The section number in which the man page should be placed (e.g.,
      <i>7</i>).</dd>
  <dt><i>date</i></dt>
  <dd>The date of the last nontrivial change that was made to the man page.
      (Within the <i>man-pages</i> project, the necessary updates to these
      timestamps are handled automatically by scripts, so there is no need to
      manually update them as part of a patch.) Dates should be written in the
      form YYYY-MM-DD.</dd>
  <dt><i>source</i></dt>
  <dd>The source of the command, function, or system call.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>For those few <i>man-pages</i> pages in Sections 1 and 8, probably you
      just want to write <i>GNU</i>.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>For system calls, just write <i>Linux</i>. (An earlier practice was to
      write the version number of the kernel from which the manual page was
      being written/checked. However, this was never done consistently, and so
      was probably worse than including no version number. Henceforth, avoid
      including a version number.)</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>For library calls that are part of glibc or one of the other common GNU
      libraries, just use <i>GNU C Library</i>, <i>GNU</i>, or an empty
    string.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>For Section 4 pages, use <i>Linux</i>.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>In cases of doubt, just write <i>Linux</i>, or <i>GNU</i>.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt><i>manual</i></dt>
  <dd>The title of the manual (e.g., for Section 2 and 3 pages in the

<p class="Pp"><i>Where a traditional heading would apply</i>, <i>please use
    it</i>; this kind of consistency can make the information easier to
    understand. If you must, you can create your own headings if they make
    things easier to understand (this can be especially useful for pages in
    Sections 4 and 5). However, before doing this, consider whether you could
    use the traditional headings, with some subsections (<i>.SS</i>) within
    those sections.</p>
<p class="Pp">The following list elaborates on the contents of each of the above
    sections.</p>

  <dd>For commands, this shows the syntax of the command and its arguments
      (including options); boldface is used for as-is text and italics are used
      to indicate replaceable arguments. Brackets ([]) surround optional
      arguments, vertical bars (|) separate choices, and ellipses (...) can be
      repeated. For functions, it shows any required data declarations or
      <b>#include</b> directives, followed by the function declaration.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Where a feature test macro must be defined in order to obtain the
      declaration of a function (or a variable) from a header file, then the

  <dd>Discuss how it interacts with files and standard input, and what it
      produces on standard output or standard error. Omit internals and
      implementation details unless they're critical for understanding the
      interface. Describe the usual case; for information on command-line
      options of a program use the <b>OPTIONS</b> section.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>When describing new behavior or new flags for a system call or library
      function, be careful to note the kernel or C library version that
      introduced the change. The preferred method of noting this information for

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Where several different conditions produce the same error, the preferred
      approach is to create separate list entries (with duplicate error names)
      for each of the conditions. This makes the separate conditions clear, may
      make the list easier to read, and allows metainformation (e.g., kernel
      version number where the condition first became applicable) to be more
      easily marked for each condition.</dd>

<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Give the full pathname of these files, and use the installation process to
      modify the directory part to match user preferences. For many programs,

      or library function appeared, or changed significantly in its
    operation.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>As a general rule, every new interface should include a VERSIONS section
      in its manual page. Unfortunately, many existing manual pages don't
      include this information (since there was no policy to do so when they
      were written). Patches to remedy this are welcome, but, from the
      perspective of programmers writing new code, this information probably
      matters only in the case of kernel interfaces that have been added in
      Linux 2.4 or later (i.e., changes since kernel 2.2), and library functions
      that have been added to glibc since version 2.1 (i.e., changes since glibc
      2.0).</dd>

  <dt></dt>
  <dd>The preferred terms to use for the various standards are listed as
      headings in <b>standards</b>(7).</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>For a page in Section 2 or 3, this section should note the POSIX.1
      version(s) that the call conforms to, and also whether the call is
      specified in C99. (Don't worry too much about other standards like SUS,
      SUSv2, and XPG, or the SVr4 and 4.xBSD implementation standards, unless
      the call was specified in those standards, but isn't in the current
      version of POSIX.1.)</dd>

      better not to clutter every page with a list of (over time potentially
      numerous) authors; if you write or significantly amend a page, add a
      copyright notice as a comment in the source file. If you are the author of

  <dd>Where the SEE ALSO list contains many long manual page names, to improve
      the visual result of the output, it may be useful to employ the <i>.ad

      Hyphenation of individual page names can be prevented by preceding words
      with the string &quot;\%&quot;.</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Given the distributed, autonomous nature of FOSS projects and their

<h2 class="Ss" id="Formatting_conventions_for_manual_pages_describing_commands"><a class="permalink" href="#Formatting_conventions_for_manual_pages_describing_commands">Formatting
  conventions for manual pages describing commands</a></h2>
For manual pages that describe a command (typically in Sections 1 and 8), the
  arguments are always specified using italics, <i>even in the SYNOPSIS
  section</i>.
<p class="Pp">The name of the command, and its options, should always be
    formatted in bold.</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Formatting_conventions_for_manual_pages_describing_functions"><a class="permalink" href="#Formatting_conventions_for_manual_pages_describing_functions">Formatting
  conventions for manual pages describing functions</a></h2>
For manual pages that describe functions (typically in Sections 2 and 3), the
  arguments are always specified using italics, <i>even in the SYNOPSIS
  section</i>, where the rest of the function is specified in bold:
<p class="Pp"><b> int myfunction(int </b><i>argc</i><b>, char
    **</b><i>argv</i><b>);</b></p>
<p class="Pp">Variable names should, like argument names, be specified in
    italics.</p>
<p class="Pp">Any reference to the subject of the current manual page should be
    written with the name in bold followed by a pair of parentheses in Roman
    (normal) font. For example, in the <b>fcntl</b>(2) man page, references to
    the subject of the page would be written as: <b>fcntl</b>(). The preferred
    way to write this in the source file is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    .BR fcntl ()
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(Using this format, rather than the use of &quot;\fB...\fP()&quot;
    makes it easier to write tools that parse man page source files.)</p>
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Use_semantic_newlines"><a class="permalink" href="#Use_semantic_newlines">Use
  semantic newlines</a></h2>
In the source of a manual page, new sentences should be started on new lines,
  and long sentences should split into lines at clause breaks (commas,
  semicolons, colons, and so on). This convention, sometimes known as
  &quot;semantic newlines&quot;, makes it easier to see the effect of patches,
  which often operate at the level of individual sentences or sentence clauses.
</section>
<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Formatting_conventions_(general)"><a class="permalink" href="#Formatting_conventions_(general)">Formatting
  conventions (general)</a></h2>
Paragraphs should be separated by suitable markers (usually either <i>.PP</i> or
  <i>.IP</i>). Do <i>not</i> separate paragraphs using blank lines, as this
  results in poor rendering in some output formats (such as PostScript and PDF).
<p class="Pp">Filenames (whether pathnames, or references to header files) are
    always in italics (e.g., <i>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</i>), except in the SYNOPSIS
    section, where included files are in bold (e.g., <b>#include
    &lt;stdio.h&gt;</b>). When referring to a standard header file include,
    specify the header file surrounded by angle brackets, in the usual C way
    (e.g., <i>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</i>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Special macros, which are usually in uppercase, are in bold (e.g.,
    <b>MAXINT</b>). Exception: don't boldface NULL.</p>
<p class="Pp">When enumerating a list of error codes, the codes are in bold
    (this list usually uses the <b>.TP</b> macro).</p>
<p class="Pp">Complete commands should, if long, be written as an indented line
    on their own, with a blank line before and after the command, for
  example</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
man 7 man-pages

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">If the command is short, then it can be included inline in the
    text, in italic format, for example, <i>man 7 man-pages</i>. In this case,
    it may be worth using nonbreaking spaces (&quot;\&#x00A0;&quot;) at suitable
    places in the command. Command options should be written in italics (e.g.,
    <i>-l</i>).</p>
<p class="Pp">Expressions, if not written on a separate indented line, should be
    specified in italics. Again, the use of nonbreaking spaces may be
    appropriate if the expression is inlined with normal text.</p>
<p class="Pp">When showing example shell sessions, user input should be
    formatted in bold, for example</p>
<p class="Pp">
  <br/>
</p>
<pre>
$ <b>date</b>
Thu Jul  7 13:01:27 CEST 2016

</pre>
<br/>
<p class="Pp">Any reference to another man page should be written with the name
    in bold, <i>always</i> followed by the section number, formatted in Roman
    (normal) font, without any separating spaces (e.g., <b>intro</b>(2)). The
    preferred way to write this in the source file is:</p>
<p class="Pp"></p>
<pre>
    .BR intro (2)
</pre>
<p class="Pp">(Including the section number in cross references lets tools like
    <b>man2html</b>(1) create properly hyperlinked pages.)</p>
<p class="Pp">Control characters should be written in bold face, with no quotes;
    for example, <b>^X</b>.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="BSD_version_numbers"><a class="permalink" href="#BSD_version_numbers">BSD
  version numbers</a></h2>
The classical scheme for writing BSD version numbers is <i>x.yBSD</i>, where
  <i>x.y</i> is the version number (e.g., 4.2BSD). Avoid forms such as <i>BSD
  4.3</i>.

<h2 class="Ss" id="Capitalization"><a class="permalink" href="#Capitalization">Capitalization</a></h2>
In subsection (&quot;SS&quot;) headings, capitalize the first word in the
  heading, but otherwise use lowercase, except where English usage (e.g., proper
  nouns) or programming language requirements (e.g., identifier names) dictate
  otherwise. For example:

When structure definitions, shell session logs, and so on are included in
  running text, indent them by 4 spaces (i.e., a block enclosed by
  <i>.in&#x00A0;+4n</i> and <i>.in</i>), format them using the <i>.EX</i> and
  <i>EE</i> macros, and surround them with suitable paragraph markers (either
  <i>.PP</i> or <i>.IP</i>). For example:
<p class="Pp">

<pre>
    .PP
    .in +4n
    .EX

<h2 class="Ss" id="Trademarks"><a class="permalink" href="#Trademarks">Trademarks</a></h2>
Use the correct spelling and case for trademarks. The following is a list of the
  correct spellings of various relevant trademarks that are sometimes
  misspelled:
<p class="Pp">
   DG/UX
   HP-UX
   UNIX
   UnixWare</p>

  NUL, null pointer, and null character</a></h2>
A <i>null pointer</i> is a pointer that points to nothing, and is normally
  indicated by the constant <i>NULL</i>. On the other hand, <i>NUL</i> is the
  <i>null byte</i>, a byte with the value 0, represented in C via the character
  constant <i>'\0'</i>.
<p class="Pp">The preferred term for the pointer is &quot;null pointer&quot; or
    simply &quot;NULL&quot;; avoid writing &quot;NULL pointer&quot;.</p>
<p class="Pp">The preferred term for the byte is &quot;null byte&quot;. Avoid
    writing &quot;NUL&quot;, since it is too easily confused with
    &quot;NULL&quot;. Avoid also the terms &quot;zero byte&quot; and &quot;null
    character&quot;. The byte that terminates a C string should be described as
    &quot;the terminating null byte&quot;; strings may be described as
    &quot;null-terminated&quot;, but avoid the use of
    &quot;NUL-terminated&quot;.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Hyperlinks"><a class="permalink" href="#Hyperlinks">Hyperlinks</a></h2>
For hyperlinks, use the <i>.UR</i>/<i>.UE</i> macro pair (see
  <b>groff_man</b>(7)). This produces proper hyperlinks that can be used in a
  web browser, when rendering a page with, say:
<p class="Pp">
   BROWSER=firefox man -H pagename</p>

  of e.g., i.e., etc., a.k.a., and similar</a></h2>
In general, the use of abbreviations such as &quot;e.g.&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot;,
  &quot;etc.&quot;, &quot;cf.&quot;, and &quot;a.k.a.&quot; should be avoided,
  in favor of suitable full wordings (&quot;for example&quot;, &quot;that
  is&quot;, &quot;compare to&quot;, &quot;and so on&quot;, &quot;also known
  as&quot;).
<p class="Pp">The only place where such abbreviations may be acceptable is in
    <i>short</i> parenthetical asides (e.g., like this one).</p>
<p class="Pp">Always include periods in such abbreviations, as shown here. In
    addition, &quot;e.g.&quot; and &quot;i.e.&quot; should always be followed by
    a comma.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Em-dashes"><a class="permalink" href="#Em-dashes">Em-dashes</a></h2>
The way to write an em-dash&#x2014;the glyph that appears at either end of this
  subphrase&#x2014;in *roff is with the macro &quot;\(em&quot;. (On an ASCII
  terminal, an em-dash typically renders as two hyphens, but in other
  typographical contexts it renders as a long dash.) Em-dashes should be written
  <i>without</i> surrounding spaces.

<h2 class="Ss" id="Hyphenation_of_attributive_compounds"><a class="permalink" href="#Hyphenation_of_attributive_compounds">Hyphenation
  of attributive compounds</a></h2>
Compound terms should be hyphenated when used attributively (i.e., to qualify a
  following noun). Some examples:
<p class="Pp">
   32-bit value
   command-line argument
   floating-point number
   run-time check
   user-space function
   wide-character string</p>
</section>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Hyphenation_with_multi,_non,_pre,_re,_sub,_and_so_on"><a class="permalink" href="#Hyphenation_with_multi,_non,_pre,_re,_sub,_and_so_on">Hyphenation
  with multi, non, pre, re, sub, and so on</a></h2>
The general tendency in modern English is not to hyphenate after prefixes such
  as &quot;multi&quot;, &quot;non&quot;, &quot;pre&quot;, &quot;re&quot;,
  &quot;sub&quot;, and so on. Manual pages should generally follow this rule
  when these prefixes are used in natural English constructions with simple
  suffixes. The following list gives some examples of the preferred forms:
<p class="Pp">
   interprocess
   multithreaded
   multiprocess
   nonblocking
   nondefault
   nonempty
   noninteractive
   nonnegative
   nonportable
   nonzero
   preallocated
   precreate
   prerecorded
   reestablished
   reinitialize
   rearm
   reread
   subcomponent
   subdirectory
   subsystem</p>
<p class="Pp">Hyphens should be retained when the prefixes are used in
    nonstandard English words, with trademarks, proper nouns, acronyms, or
    compound terms. Some examples:</p>
<p class="Pp">
   non-ASCII
   non-English
   non-NULL
   non-real-time</p>
<p class="Pp">Finally, note that &quot;re-create&quot; and &quot;recreate&quot;
    are two different verbs, and the former is probably what you want.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Real_minus_character"><a class="permalink" href="#Real_minus_character">Real
  minus character</a></h2>
Where a real minus character is required (e.g., for numbers such as -1, for man
  page cross references such as <b>utf-8</b>(7), or when writing options that
  have a leading dash, such as in <i>ls&#x00A0;-l</i>), use the following form
  in the man page source:
<p class="Pp">

<section class="Ss">
<h2 class="Ss" id="Character_constants"><a class="permalink" href="#Character_constants">Character
  constants</a></h2>
To produce single quotes that render well in both ASCII and UTF-8, use the
  following form for character constants in the man page source:
<p class="Pp">
   \(aqC\(aq</p>
<p class="Pp">where <i>C</i> is the quoted character. This guideline applies
    also to character constants used in code examples.</p>

<h2 class="Ss" id="Example_programs_and_shell_sessions"><a class="permalink" href="#Example_programs_and_shell_sessions">Example
  programs and shell sessions</a></h2>
Manual pages may include example programs demonstrating how to use a system call
  or library function. However, note the following:
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Example programs should be written in C.</li>
  <li>An example program is necessary and useful only if it demonstrates
      something beyond what can easily be provided in a textual description of
      the interface. An example program that does nothing other than call an
      interface usually serves little purpose.</li>
  <li>Example programs should be fairly short (preferably less than 100 lines;
      ideally less than 50 lines).</li>
  <li>Example programs should do error checking after system calls and library
      function calls.</li>
  <li>Example programs should be complete, and compile without warnings when
      compiled with <i>cc&#x00A0;-Wall</i>.</li>
  <li>Where possible and appropriate, example programs should allow
      experimentation, by varying their behavior based on inputs (ideally from
      command-line arguments, or alternatively, via input read by the
    program).</li>
  <li>Example programs should be laid out according to Kernighan and Ritchie
      style, with 4-space indents. (Avoid the use of TAB characters in source
      code!) The following command can be used to format your source code to
      something close to the preferred style:</li>
</ul>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
     indent -npro -kr -i4 -ts4 -sob -l72 -ss -nut -psl prog.c</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>*</dt>
  <dd>For consistency, all example programs should terminate using either
    of:</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
     exit(EXIT_SUCCESS);
     exit(EXIT_FAILURE);</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Avoid using the following forms to terminate a program:</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
     exit(0);
     exit(1);
     return n;</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt>*</dt>
  <dd>If there is extensive explanatory text before the program source code,
      mark off the source code with a subsection heading <i>Program source</i>,
      as in:</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="Bl-tag">
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>
     .SS Program source</dd>
  <dt></dt>
  <dd>Always do this if the explanatory text includes a shell session log.</dd>
</dl>
<p class="Pp">If you include a shell session log demonstrating the use of a
    program or other system feature:</p>
<ul class="Bl-bullet">
  <li>Place the session log above the source code listing</li>
  <li>Indent the session log by four spaces.</li>
  <li>Boldface the user input text, to distinguish it from output produced by
      the system.</li>
