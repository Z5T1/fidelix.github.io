  Free Software</a></h2>
If you want to have more free software a few years from now, it makes sense for
  you to help encourage people to contribute funds for its development. The most
  effective approach known is to encourage commercial redistributors to donate.
<p class="Pp">Users of free software systems can boost the pace of development
    by encouraging for-a-fee distributors to donate part of their selling price
    to free software developers---the Free Software Foundation, and others.</p>
<p class="Pp">The way to convince distributors to do this is to demand it and
    expect it from them. So when you compare distributors, judge them partly by
    how much they give to free software development. Show distributors they must
    compete to be the one who gives the most.</p>
<p class="Pp">To make this approach work, you must insist on numbers that you
    can compare, such as, &quot;We will donate ten dollars to the Frobnitz
    project for each disk sold.&quot; Don't be satisfied with a vague promise,
    such as &quot;A portion of the profits are donated,&quot; since it doesn't
    give a basis for comparison.</p>
<p class="Pp">Even a precise fraction &quot;of the profits from this disk&quot;
    is not very meaningful, since creative accounting and unrelated business
    decisions can greatly alter what fraction of the sales price counts as
    profit. If the price you pay is <span class="Li">$50</span>, ten percent of
    the profit is probably less than a dollar; it might be a few cents, or
    nothing at all.</p>
<p class="Pp">Some redistributors do development work themselves. This is useful
    too; but to keep everyone honest, you need to inquire how much they do, and
    what kind. Some kinds of development make much more long-term difference
    than others. For example, maintaining a separate version of a program
    contributes very little; maintaining the standard version of a program for
    the whole community contributes much. Easy new ports contribute little,
    since someone else would surely do them; difficult ports such as adding a
    new CPU to the GNU Compiler Collection contribute more; major new features
    or packages contribute the most.</p>
<p class="Pp">By establishing the idea that supporting further development is
    &quot;the proper thing to do&quot; when distributing free software for a
    fee, we can assure a steady flow of resources into making more free
    software.</p>
